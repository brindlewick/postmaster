# Acceptance oracle for parallel runs: nothing in skills/, AGENTS.md, README.md or the
# wiki still says two runs must not change the same files. Runs go in parallel up to
# `team.max_runs`, and whichever merges second resolves the conflicts at its merge.
# Five checks name one stale sentence each from before that change, matched verbatim
# after newlines are folded (carriage returns stripped first, so CRLF never hides one),
# and five match the claim itself in every file in scope (`overlapping file surfaces`,
# `never two runs on`, `not change/touch/edit the same files`): a new sentence in one
# of these phrasings trips the same guard. Further paraphrases are beyond a grep oracle.
# Six presence checks hold the sections that survive: step 6 still exists as the
# Order-them step under Stage A and orders by dependencies within its own lines (a
# word-boundary match, so `independence` never satisfies it), the `team.max_runs`
# hard-rule limit stays verbatim, and the concurrency note is rewritten, not deleted,
# keeping second-resolves and never-rebase. The replacement wording beyond those pins
# is judged by reading, not by this script.
#
#   parallel-runs-acceptance.sh [repo-root]   default: the repo this script lives in

#                                             a clean tree passes, and the live tree passes
#
#   exit 0  no stale claim remains
#   exit 1  stale claims, one per line on stdout: <file>: <what is still claimed>
#   exit 2  usage, a file that cannot be read, or a tree that cannot be fully swept
#
# The self-test fails on a tree that still carries the old claims, at its live-tree step;
# that failure is the control proving the checks bite on the real files, not only fixtures.
