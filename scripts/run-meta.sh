#   run-meta.sh <dispatch> <repo>   <repo> is the target project's checkout; also cuts the pin
#   run-meta.sh pin <repo> <commit> a shared checkout of <repo> at <commit> under $POSTMASTER_TOOL_PINS
#   run-meta.sh path <dispatch>     print the canonical path of the run's tool checkout

# Records when it was written; the run and project; the target repo's HEAD and branch; the
# postmaster commit that dispatched it, and whether that checkout had uncommitted changes,
# since a run keeps the runbooks it started with; the pinned checkout of that commit, which
# every leg launch, resume and takeover runs from (the waybill's `tool:`); the config in force,
# as it was; and the version each harness named in that config reports. Env files are named by
# the config, never read. A run.json that already exists is left alone.
#
# The pin is a detached worktree of the postmaster repo at the dispatch commit, under
# $POSTMASTER_TOOL_PINS (default ~/.postmaster/tool-pins), one directory per commit so every
# run dispatched at that commit shares it. It is the run's `<tool>`: its host.sh, its launch.sh
# and the runbooks its prompts name. The live checkout still serves the front door and the
# postmaster's own supervision.
#
# check is the control that a run still runs on its own versions after main has moved on: it
# reads the pin's HEAD and tree against the commit run.json records. release removes the pin
# only when no run whose run.json names it is still in flight (manifest stage other than done
# or abandoned). The postmaster releases after it closes or abandons a run, never before the
# last leg's process has exited. A run with no checkout recorded (an old unpinned waybill)
# resolves to the tool path its waybill already names; check asks only that it is a git
# checkout, and release leaves it alone.
