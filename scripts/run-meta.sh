# Write a run's fixed facts to <dispatch>/run.json, once, at dispatch, and pin the run to the
# postmaster commit it was dispatched from. Written once and never edited: the manifest is the
# run's current state, this is what the run started from and the checkout it runs on.
#
#   run-meta.sh <dispatch> <repo>   <repo> is the target project's checkout; also cuts the pin
#   run-meta.sh pin <repo> <commit> a shared checkout of <repo> at <commit> under $POSTMASTER_TOOL_PINS
#   run-meta.sh path <dispatch>     print the canonical path of the run's tool checkout
#   run-meta.sh check <dispatch>    the run's checkout still serves its dispatch commit
#   run-meta.sh release <dispatch>  remove the pin when no claimed run is in flight
#   run-meta.sh --self-test
#
# Records when it was written; the run and project; the target repo's HEAD and branch; the
# postmaster commit that dispatched it, and whether that checkout had uncommitted changes,
# since a run keeps the runbooks it started with; the coachman contract version; the pinned
# checkout of that commit, which every leg launch, resume and takeover runs from (the
# waybill's `tool:`); the machine config with local role choices resolved; the project
# settings and their sources; and the version each harness reports. Env files are named by
# the machine config, never read. A run.json that already exists is left alone.
#
# The pin is a detached worktree of the postmaster repo at the dispatch commit, under
# $POSTMASTER_TOOL_PINS (default ~/.postmaster/tool-pins), one directory per commit so every
# run dispatched at that commit shares it. It is the run's `<tool>`: its host.sh, its launch.sh
# and the runbooks its prompts name. The live checkout still serves the front door and the
# postmaster's own supervision. A bare `pin` holds no claim; each dispatch appends its own
# path to the pin's claims file beside it, so release finds every run that names the pin,
# whatever project it lives in and whichever runs layout it uses.
#
# check is the control that a run still runs on its own versions after main has moved on: it
# reads the pin's HEAD and tree against the commit run.json records. release removes the pin
# only when no claimed run is still in flight (manifest stage other than done or abandoned,
# a claim that cannot be read counting as in flight); a pin with no claims file falls back to
# scanning the runs root the dispatch sits under, and runs it cannot list keep the pin.
# Dispatch holds one lock across its pin, claim and run.json write and release across its
# check and removal, so the two serialize; release force-removes an unreferenced pin that is
# not clean, and leaves a locked one alone. A dispatch whose run.json write fails drops the
# claim it just made, so the pin stays unreferenced; a crash between the two leaves a stale
# claim that keeps the pin, for manual recovery. The postmaster releases
# after it closes or abandons a run, never
# before the last leg's process has exited. A run with no checkout recorded (an old unpinned
# waybill) resolves to the tool path its waybill already names; check asks only that it is a
# git checkout, and release leaves it alone.
#
