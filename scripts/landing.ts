//   run landing already-landed --repo <repo> --default <branch> --ticket <ref> --base <sha>
//       --card-head <sha> [--local-ticket <branch>] [--pr-merge <sha> --pr-head <sha>]
//       whether the ticket branch already landed. `landed` when the default branch contains
//       the ticket's HEAD and that HEAD is not the run's BASE, or when the provider reports
//       the pull request merged at the card's HEAD: --pr-merge names the merge commit it
//       reports, --pr-head the head it reports the pull request merged at, the merge is on
//       the default branch, and the reported head equals the card's HEAD. No content is
//       compared: a squash or rebase merge counts only as one the provider reports, with
//       both SHAs from its report, never from the local ticket ref, so a pruned or deleted
//       branch still answers. `unpushed` when --local-ticket names the local branch, it is
//       at the card's HEAD, and the ticket ref is behind that HEAD: push, re-fetch, and ask
//       again. `re-verify`, never `landed`, when the ticket ref and the card's HEAD
//       otherwise differ, or when a reported merge names another head: a reported
//       head that does not resolve locally names another head too, since the card's
//       HEAD resolved. Otherwise `not-landed`.
//   run landing anything-to-land --repo <repo> --default <branch> --ticket <ref> --base <sha>
//       whether the branch holds anything to land. `nothing-to-land` when the ticket's diff
//       against BASE is empty (its HEAD is BASE, whatever the default branch holds), or when
//       the default branch contains its HEAD. Otherwise `land`: a squash merge the provider
//       did not report is out of scope, and the pull request shows a person what landed.
//   run landing fresh --repo <repo> --default <branch> --ticket <ref>
//       --dispatch <dispatch> --wt <synthesis-wt>
//       whether the ticket is fresh to land. Prints `fresh` when the ticket branch contains
//       the current default branch, the worktree is at the ticket's head, and `run verify
//       results` shows the gate passing at that head. Otherwise one fault line each for the
//       head the worktree is not at, the default branch the ticket lacks, and the gate
//       that is not passing.
//   run landing results <dispatch> <synthesis-wt>
//       every recorded check's result at the worktree's HEAD, one `name: result` line each,
//       as the cards carry them. This is the one place the vocabulary mapping lives:
//       `no result logged` reads as `not run`, and the `at ...` suffix is dropped.
//   run landing card-block <dispatch> <synthesis-wt> <checkpoint>
//       the card's checked sections rendered from their sources as one exact block of
//       text: `## Checks` with one `- <name>: <result>` bullet per recorded check in
//       recorded order, then `## Open findings` with one `- [<severity>] <id>` bullet
//       per open checkpoint finding in file order, then `## Not re-reviewed` with one
//       `- [<severity>] <id>` bullet per user-applied finding in file order; an empty
//       section renders as `none`. The checkpoint gives each finding one bullet
//       `- [<severity>] <id>: <state>` with the state `open`, `closed round <n>`,
//       `dismissed: <reason>`, or `applied on user word, not re-reviewed`; a `-`, `*`
//       or `+` bullet starting `[`, or a numbered or bare line shaped as a finding
//       (`[` plus severity digit, an id, then a colon or end of line), that is not
//       such a finding is an input fault. A fence marker line is an input fault too.
//       The review leg writes this block into the card verbatim. Prints the block.
//   run landing card-results <dispatch> <synthesis-wt> <checkpoint> <card>
//   run landing card-findings <dispatch> <synthesis-wt> <checkpoint> <card>
//       whether the card holds the block `card-block` renders, as an exact, contiguous
//       byte string, found once. Nothing is parsed: a card holding `<!--` anywhere is an
//       input fault, and otherwise a card whose block differs in any way, or that holds
//       it never or more than once, is an input fault, never `match`. A card quoting
//       `<!--` escapes it, for example as `&lt;!--`. A copy inside a
//       code fence is text a reader sees, so it counts like any other copy.
//   run landing card-open <checkpoint>
//       the checkpoint's open P1 and P2 findings, one `- [<severity>] <id>` bullet
//       each, or `none`. Open P3 residue prints `none`: it lands.
//   run landing journey <dispatch> <synthesis-wt> <waybill>
//       whether the journey holds landing. Whether the waybill mentions a user journey
//       is asked of `run ticket-check --has-journey`, the flow's one reading of a ticket.
//       `clear` when no check's source names `web-journey`, or when the report exists and
//       the journey check passed. `blocked` when the waybill mentions one, a check uses
//       `web-journey`, and the report is missing or the check did not run: missing
//       evidence, not a result to weigh. `judge` when the waybill mentions none, or the
//       journey check failed with its report written: the postmaster weighs it like any
//       other non-pass.
//   run landing switch-offs --repo <repo> --default <branch> --ticket <ref>
//       every switch-off comment and check-settings change the ticket's head adds over the
//       merge base of the ticket and the default branch. Only real comments count: strings,
//       template-literal text and regex literals are not comments, and only TypeScript's,
//       the linter's (eslint and oxlint spellings) and Biome's forms switch anything off. A
//       settings file anywhere in the tree (the tsconfig*, jsconfig*, oxlint, eslint, biome,
//       prettier and bunfig names, plus package.json when its scripts or a tool's settings
//       block changes) is one entry with its diff when its content changes. Prints a status
//       line — `clear`, `held` or `no reason` — then the `## Switch-offs` section: one line
//       per added comment with its file, line, form, rules, reason and identity, one line
//       per added settings file with its diff, or `none`. What the merge base already holds
//       is not added, so a switch-off that main has is never listed, and removing a
//       switch-off is not listed either. An identity the project's ledger at the repo holds
//       an `approved` switch-off line for is marked `(approved)` and does not hold the
//       branch; a `refused` line does not clear it.
//   exit 0  already-landed, anything-to-land, results, card-block, card-open: the answer,
