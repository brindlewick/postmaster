# skill. An installed skill is a link from a harness's skills folder into the postmaster repo,

# A reference resolves from any working directory only when it goes through <tool> and names
# a script the repo has.

# A reference is any scripts/ path. It is a fault when it is bare (scripts/x.sh, which resolves
# only from the repo's own root), when it reaches scripts/ some other way (../../scripts/x.sh),
# or when it goes through <tool> to a script the repo does not have. A path under another
# placeholder or variable, such as <repo>/scripts/, is that directory's and not the tool's.
# --fix rewrites the bare form only, so it can be run again after a rebase and changes nothing
# the second time; the check that follows it names whatever it could not fix.
#
#   exit 0  every reference resolves
#   exit 1  faults, one per line on stdout: <file>:<line>: <reason>: <reference>
