#
# run: <command> is the same headless command a caller would otherwise background with `&`. It
# runs from the directory host.sh was called in, with the caller's environment and an empty
# stdin, in a session of its own with no terminal; its stdout goes to --out, added to with
# --append, and its stderr to --err, which holds only this launch's errors. --marker is removed
# as it starts and touched when it exits,
# whatever its exit, and also when host.sh cannot start it, with the reason in --err. --pidfile
# gets its pid, which is also its process group: `kill -- -<pid>` stops all of it. <cwd> is the
# directory the launch belongs to, usually its worktree: in Herdr the launch runs in a new tab of
# that worktree's space, opened with `herdr worktree open` under the repository's space if it is
# not open yet; in tmux in a window of session postmaster-<repo>; with no host, detached from
# the caller. A run launch's <cwd>, including a reviewer's scratch clone, is its tab's working
# directory inside the run's synthesis-worktree space in Herdr. In tmux a scratch clone joins
# the session of the repository it was cut from. <name> labels the tab or window and the pane's
# title, and names the thread where the harness can (POSTMASTER_LAUNCH_NAME, read by launch.sh).
# Pass a role-specific `host.sh name` result as the launch name and pass the dispatch separately,
# so the ticket title labels only the run space and never passes through a shell. A pane shows
# the stream through view-stream.sh. A launch carries its own pane's
# identity (HERDR_PANE_ID and the like, or TMUX_PANE), never its caller's. If the host cannot
# place it, it runs in the background. While it runs it is registered under
# POSTMASTER_HOST_STATE (default ~/.postmaster/host), whatever its host, so stop and close see it.
# The record names its group leader by start time and boot, so a pid another process reuses,
# after a reboot or within one, is never taken for the launch.
#
# stop: a launch's processes are its process group and everything they started, whatever session
# that moved to, as a harness that runs each tool command in a session of its own does. They are
# found by process id and parent, never by a command line; frozen first, so nothing forks
# between the listing and the signal; sent TERM; and sent KILL if still there after
# POSTMASTER_HOST_STOP_WAIT seconds. The process that ran stop, and those above it, never are.
# Before it signals anything it checks the whole set, and refuses, leaving everything running,
# if the set holds a systemd manager, the Herdr server or a Herdr client, the moshi-hook daemon,
# code-server, the tmux server, sshd, a process that is neither in a verified launch's group nor
# descended from one, or more than POSTMASTER_HOST_STOP_MAX processes.
#
# POSTMASTER_HOST=herdr|tmux|none overrides detection; nothing needs setting to get the default.
# POSTMASTER_HOST_CLAIM_WAIT (20) is how long a new pane has to start its launch,
# POSTMASTER_HOST_CLOSE_WAIT (15) how long close waits for a launch that is just ending, and
# POSTMASTER_HOST_STOP_WAIT (20) how long stop waits after TERM before it sends KILL, and
# POSTMASTER_HOST_STOP_MAX (512) the most processes one stop may signal.
#
#   exit 0  detected, named, started, stopped, closed, sent, settled or read
#   exit 1  usage, or nothing could be started
#   exit 2  close refused: a launch still runs in the worktree, or an affected pane or space
#           holds something host.sh did not open; or stop left something of a launch running,
#           named, or refused a set of processes it could not vouch for, saying why

# --- the registry of running launches ------------------------------------------------------
# One file per launch, named for its process group: the directory it was placed in, its name,
# `start <t>` for its group leader's start time (field 22 of /proc/<pid>/stat, or what ps prints
# where there is no /proc) and `boot <id>` for the boot it started in. A pid is reused, after a
# reboot and within one, so a record stands for a launch only while that same leader is alive in
# that same boot. Once the leader has exited, its runner writes `member <pid> <t>` for each
# process still in its group, and the record stands for those that still match. A record that
# stands for nothing is removed by whoever reads it next. One written before the start and boot
# lines existed is kept only if it was written in this boot by a leader that had already started,
# and it is then rewritten with them.
