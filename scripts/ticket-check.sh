#                                                         journey section, read as below, with a

#                                                         punctuation allowed besides the colon
#   ticket-check.sh --self-test
#
# What it judges, and nothing more:
#   - The title has words: the one the adapter read, or the one --title gives.
#   - `## Problem / feature`, `## Acceptance criteria`, `## Direction` and `## Turnpikes` are
#     each present once, at level two, in that order, with words under them. Headings match
#     ignoring case, a trailing colon, a closing run of # and the spacing around the slash.
#   - The acceptance criteria are a list numbered 1, 2, 3 in order, with nothing outside the
#     list but blank lines and thematic breaks. Indented lines, nested lists and lines running
#     straight on belong to the criterion above them.
#   - Each criterion is answerable yes or no, which here means three things a script can see:
#     it has words; it asks no question, so no question mark ends a sentence in it, closing
#     brackets and emphasis aside; and it is not marked to be decided later.
#   - No part is marked to be decided later: TBD or TBC anywhere, or TODO as the whole text or
#     followed by a colon. TODO as a word, as in "a TODO list", is not a mark.
#   - The turnpikes are `default`, `none` or turnpike names, as `scripts/turnpikes.sh resolve`
#     reads them, and every word that is not a turnpike is named. The names come from that
#     script alone, so a turnpike added there needs no change here.
# Code spans, fenced blocks and HTML comments are not read for questions, marks or headings,
# and quoted text is not read for questions. A <!-- that nothing closes is text. A heading's
# hashes must stand at the line's start as written: what follows a comment on its line is
# text, not a heading. Turnpikes are
# read from code spans too, and not from fenced blocks or HTML comments.
#
# What it does not judge: whether the description says why the change matters; whether a
# criterion is vague ("fast enough", "where possible") or can really be tested; whether the
# criteria are the right ones, or enough; what the direction says. `## Notes` and
# `## User journey` are optional and not checked. An indented code block is read as text.
#
# --splice changes nothing else: every line of <base-body> outside the sections it replaces is
# printed as it was. It is how a part the user approved is written into a ticket without
# retyping the rest. A part it would write whose name stands as a subheading inside a later
# part of the base, such as `### Direction` under `## Notes`, is refused: that heading may be the
# part at the wrong level or the user's own text, and splicing would delete it or leave two.
#
# POSTMASTER_CONFIG overrides the config path (~/.postmaster/config.toml). A tracker of kind
# `other` has no adapter script: read the ticket with its own tooling and check it with --body.
#
#   exit 0  well-formed: it prints how many acceptance criteria it has, then the turnpikes as the
#           waybill carries them, `turnpikes: <names>` or `turnpikes: none`; with --splice, the body
