# The config is the live one, ~/.postmaster/config.toml (POSTMASTER_CONFIG overrides the path),
# unless --run names the dispatch directory of the run being served. Then it is the config that
# run recorded at dispatch, `config` in <dispatch>/run.json (scripts/run-meta.sh): the live
# config is not read at all, and a run.json that is missing or unreadable is refused. Every
# launch and resume inside a run passes --run; the postmaster's own spawn and the config check
# before dispatch do not. The checks below apply to a recorded config as to the live one.
#
# <name> is a lane from [lanes.<name>], or `coachman`, `coachman_fallback` or `postmaster`
# from [team]. <leg> is synthesis, review or ship, and with --leg, [team.coachman_legs.<leg>]
# overrides the coachman for that leg. Launching or resuming `coachman` needs --leg; `form`
# without it shows team.coachman. The coachman is refused when [team.coachman_legs] names any
# other leg or holds an entry that is not a table, and the coachman and the fallback are
# refused on a lane's model. HARNESS, MODEL, EFFORT and ENV_FILE come from the config alone,
# never from the environment. The events stream goes to stdout; the caller redirects and
# backgrounds. A lane's env_file, if set, is
# loaded first, so an alternate backend for a harness is an environment file outside this
# repo, never a value in the config. --last names the file a harness writes its final message
# to, where the harness supports it (codex -o).
