# The config is the live one, ~/.postmaster/config.toml (POSTMASTER_CONFIG overrides the path),
# unless --run names the dispatch directory of the run being served. Then it is the config that
# run recorded at dispatch, `config` in <dispatch>/run.json (scripts/run-meta.sh): the live
# config is not read at all, and a run.json that is missing or unreadable is refused. Every
# launch and resume inside a run passes --run; the postmaster's own spawn and the config check
# before dispatch do not. The checks below apply to a recorded config as to the live one.
#
# <name> is a lane from [lanes.<name>], or `coachman`, `coachman_fallback` or `postmaster`
# from [team]. <leg> is synthesis, review or ship, and with --leg, [team.coachman_legs.<leg>]
# overrides the coachman for that leg. Launching or resuming `coachman` needs --leg; `form`
# without it shows team.coachman. The coachman is refused when [team.coachman_legs] names any
# other leg or holds an entry that is not a table, and the coachman and the fallback are
# refused on a lane's model, a model id's bracketed suffixes aside. HARNESS, MODEL, EFFORT and
# ENV_FILE come from the config alone, never from the environment. A lane's env_file is how a
# harness reaches an alternate backend: a file outside this repo, never a value in the config,
# and a relative path is read from the live config's directory, under --run too. It is shell,
# sourced last, once the command, its directory and its stdin are fixed, so its assignments
# reach the harness and not this script's choices; it runs as code, and is the user's to write.
# The events stream goes to stdout; the caller redirects and backgrounds. --last names the file
# a harness writes its final message to, where the harness supports it (codex -o). `skill`
# prints the prompt that invokes the lane's harness's own skill (harnesses.md, Own review
# skills); `launch` runs it like any other prompt. The one skill is security-review. `form`
# prints two lines: `launch: ` and the launch form, then `resume: ` and the resume form, or
# `resume: none: ` and why there is none.
#
# thread-id reads an events stream and prints the first thread id its shape carries (codex
# thread_id, claude session_id, grok session id, agy conversationId, pi session id, muse
# stream.id, mimo sessionID); it is how a launch's id is recorded after the stream has
# started. transient names the provider errors that are worth resuming on rather than
# escalating: a model stream idle timeout, a gateway failure, a stream drop. The set is here
# and in harnesses.md, never in the watcher. It is matched against the leg's durable record:
# its .err file and the error records in its stream tail, never a prompt or a user message.
# The tail starts after skip-lines, the lines an earlier launch wrote: a resumed stream
# keeps its history, and an old error must not classify the current end. A launch refusal,
# and a quota, payment, usage or rate wall, are never transient and take precedence over
# any transient signature.
#
#   exit 0  the forms or the skill's prompt were printed, or the harness exited 0; thread-id
#           found an id; transient matched a named provider error; wall-tokens or wall-quotes
#           listed their lines
#   exit 1  usage, config or run.json missing or unreadable, unknown name, a leg that is not

# The classifier answers one question: may the watcher resume this ending by itself?
# The answer is positive and narrow. An ending resumes only when it carries a known
# transient signature and no wall-like token anywhere in what it says; everything
# else wakes the postmaster. A false veto is a wake, which costs one look; a missed
# wall is an automatic remount against a wall. The transient set below is closed;
# the veto set is token stems (argv, printed by `launch.sh wall-tokens`).
#
# The veto reads message text only: the .err lines, non-JSON stream lines (stderr
# chunks), and every string value of the ending's error records — the records the
# adapter recognises as errors or terminal failures (harnesses.md names them per
# harness). Inside an error record every value counts, under any key; JSON keys,
# field names and numeric payloads are structure, not text, and never count — a
# "usage" key, a rate_limit key, a token count of 1429 and a UUID holding 429 are
# not walls. Text stems match as substrings on separator-stripped text, so no
# spelling, span or boundary can hide a wall; digit stems count only
# status-shaped, as whole numbers in text. An assistant's ordinary messages and
# tool output are not error records and veto nothing: agents write limit, usage,
# quota and exceed in working prose all day, and a veto over those would leave
# auto-resume never firing. Prompt values inside error records veto in the safe
# direction, as since round 6; prompt text can never authorize a resume, below.
# The first skip-lines lines are an earlier launch's: a resumed stream keeps its history
# while .err holds only the current launch, so without the skip an old transient error
# would classify a later unrelated failure as transient, and an old wall would veto a
# later transient end.
#
# Only error fields on error records contribute positive transient prose, windowed to
# the last 100 post-skip lines: a missed transient is the safe direction, it wakes.
# User and prompt fields are excluded there, so prompt text can never make a process
# eligible for an automatic remount.
#
# Structured values come in three classes, read over every post-skip line. A status
# code or error type in the known-transient set is a resume signal, on any record. A
# known-harness-internal value (a completed status, a rate_limit_event slowdown, an
# exit code, a generic timeout) is ignored. Any other numeric status under a code key
# wakes wherever it sits; any other string under a code or error-name key wakes on an
# error record, while on a non-error record it is progress noise: an unknown
# classification is a wake, never a fall-through. Bare record-shape keys (type, name)
# are labels, not classifications: a transient-set member there still signals,
# anything else is ignored. An int outside the 100-999 status shape is an exit code,
# not a status.
