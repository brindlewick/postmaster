# Launch or resume a lane or a role by name, from the config, in the exact form harnesses.md

# The config is the live one, ~/.postmaster/config.toml (POSTMASTER_CONFIG overrides the path),
# unless --run names the dispatch directory of the run being served. Then it is the config that
# run recorded at dispatch, `config` in <dispatch>/run.json (scripts/run-meta.sh): the live
# config is not read at all, and a run.json that is missing or unreadable is refused. Every
# launch and resume inside a run passes --run; the postmaster's own spawn and the config check
# before dispatch do not. The checks below apply to a recorded config as to the live one.
#
# <name> is a lane from [lanes.<name>], or `coachman`, `coachman_fallback` or `postmaster`
# from [team]. <leg> is synthesis, review or ship, and with --leg, [team.coachman_legs.<leg>]
# overrides the coachman for that leg. Launching or resuming `coachman` needs --leg; `form`
# without it shows team.coachman. The coachman is refused when [team.coachman_legs] names any
# other leg or holds an entry that is not a table, and the coachman and the fallback are
# refused on a lane's model, a model id's bracketed suffixes aside. HARNESS, MODEL, EFFORT and
# ENV_FILE come from the config alone, never from the environment. A lane's env_file is how a
# harness reaches an alternate backend: a file outside this repo, never a value in the config,
# and a relative path is read from the live config's directory, under --run too. It is shell,
# sourced last, once the command, its directory and its stdin are fixed, so its assignments
# reach the harness and not this script's choices; it runs as code, and is the user's to write.
# The events stream goes to stdout; the caller redirects and backgrounds. --last names the file
# a harness writes its final message to, where the harness supports it (codex -o). `skill`
# prints the prompt that invokes the lane's harness's own skill (harnesses.md, Own review
# skills); `launch` runs it like any other prompt. The one skill is security-review.
#
#   exit 0  the form or the skill's prompt was printed, or the harness exited 0
#   exit 1  usage, config or run.json missing or unreadable, unknown name, a leg that is not
#           synthesis, review or ship, the coachman launched or resumed with no --leg, a

#           form this script does not have (agy resume), or a skill that is not security-review
