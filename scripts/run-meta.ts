//
//   run run-meta <dispatch> <repo>   <repo> is the target project's checkout; also cuts the pin
//   run run-meta pin <repo> <commit> a shared checkout of <repo> at <commit> under $POSTMASTER_TOOL_PINS

// Records when it was written; the run and project; the target repo's HEAD and branch; the
// postmaster commit that dispatched it, and whether that checkout had uncommitted changes,
// since a run keeps the runbooks it started with; the coachman contract version; the pinned
// checkout of that commit, which every leg launch, resume and takeover runs from (the
// waybill's `tool:`); the machine config with local role choices resolved; the project
// settings and their sources; and the version each harness reports. Env files are named by
// the machine config, never read. A run.json that already exists is left alone.
//
// The pin is a detached worktree of the postmaster repo at the dispatch commit, under
// $POSTMASTER_TOOL_PINS (default ~/.postmaster/tool-pins), one directory per commit so every
// run dispatched at that commit shares it. It is the run's `<tool>`: its run host, its run launch
// and the runbooks its prompts name. The live checkout still serves the front door and the
// postmaster's own supervision. A bare `pin` holds no claim; each dispatch appends its own
// path to the pin's claims file beside it, so release finds every run that names the pin,
// whatever project it lives in and whichever runs layout it uses.
//
// check is the control that a run still runs on its own versions after main has moved on: it
// reads the pin's HEAD and tree against the commit run.json records. release removes the pin
// only when no claimed run is still in flight (manifest stage other than done or abandoned,
// a claim that cannot be read counting as in flight); a pin with no claims file falls back to
// scanning the runs root the dispatch sits under, and runs it cannot list keep the pin.
// Dispatch holds one lock across its pin, claim and run.json write and release across its
// check and removal, so the two serialize; release force-removes an unreferenced pin that is
// not clean, and leaves a locked one alone. A dispatch whose run.json write fails drops the
// claim it just made, so the pin stays unreferenced; a crash between the two leaves a stale
// claim that keeps the pin, for manual recovery. The postmaster releases
// after it closes or abandons a run, never
// before the last leg's process has exited. A run with no checkout recorded (an old unpinned
// waybill) resolves to the tool path its waybill already names; check asks only that it is a
// git checkout, and release leaves it alone.
//
//   exit 0  written, already there, a pin made or reused, path printed, the pin still serves
//           its commit, or the pin was released or kept as the in-flight runs require
//   exit 1  usage, no such dispatch directory or repo or commit, no config, the file could not
//           be written, the pin lock could not be taken, no pin or it does not serve its
//           commit, or git could not make or remove it
//
// Port notes (main scripts/run run-meta): the flock(2) pin lock is an O_EXCL lock file holding
// the owner's PID, stolen from a dead owner or an empty file old enough that no live
// creator is mid-write, never by age otherwise, since a dispatch legitimately holds it
// across 15-second harness probes; the lock file is removed on release rather than left
// behind. An empty file is the bash flow's resting state (it opens with > and flocks the
// fd, never removing it), so it reads as unlocked: exclusion between the two flows is
// best-effort during the transition, exact within this one. The pin scan keeps its
// subprocess shape (a hidden `run-meta-scan`
// mode of this same script, exit 42 the reserved drop signal) so a killed scan is still
// observed and kept; the child is spawned with PATH alone, the tool bunfig.toml anchoring
// config discovery the way the wrapper does. POSTMASTER_SCAN_HOLD_MS is test-only: the
// scan child sleeps that long before enumerating, so the killed-scan control kills
// deterministically instead of racing a millisecond scan.
