# is the agent's: it follows each step in a browser, through the project's own browser library,
# and writes a report. This script holds that report to the ticket: every step of the ticket's
# `## User journey`, in the ticket's order, marked did or did not, with a screenshot beside the
# report, in its directory or below it, so a walk leaves nothing in the worktree it walked.

# walk counts only for the commit it walked. <dir> is --dir, else the journey directory of the
# checks scripts/verify.sh arm copied ($POSTMASTER_VERIFY/spec.json, else
# .postmaster/verify/spec.json), else .postmaster/verify/journey. <worktree> defaults to the

Walk the ticket's User journey in a browser, through the project's own browser library, at the
commit you are reporting on. Write the report to the path `verify.sh journey-path` prints for
that commit. For each step, in the ticket's order: a `## ` heading holding the step as the
ticket words it; under it a line `did`, or `did not: <what happened instead>`; then a line
`screenshot: <path>`, the path, relative to the report, of a screenshot of that step saved in the
report's directory or below it. Steps of your own may follow the ticket's.
