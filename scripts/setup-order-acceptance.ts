// Acceptance oracle for setup asking which project to work on before anything else:
// the project question comes first, offers postmaster itself or another project, and
// offers the session's own project first when it stands in one; the README names both
// ways to start. Nine stale sentences and phrases from the config-first order must be
// gone, matched verbatim after newlines are folded (carriage returns stripped first,
// so CRLF never hides one); five phrases the new order says must be present; and two
// section orders must hold. Further paraphrases are beyond a grep oracle. Any
// conditional rewrite breaks every match.
//
//   run setup-order-acceptance [repo-root]   default: the repo this script lives in
//
//   exit 0  the project question comes first, everywhere it is stated
//   exit 1  stale order remains, one fault per line on stdout: <file>: <what is wrong>
//   exit 2  usage, or a file that cannot be read
