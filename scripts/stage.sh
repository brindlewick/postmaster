# Move a run to a stage. This is the one way a run's stage changes, so every change is logged,

# written by hand.

# It logs a `stage` action naming the stage left and how long it lasted, changes only the
# manifest's `stage` field, and appends the same line to run-log.md. Setting the stage a run is
# already in does nothing, so a resumed or remounted leg can set it again safely. Setting a
# terminal stage (done, abandoned) appends timings and refreshes the final usage sum after every
# launch has exited.
# Only the postmaster sets a terminal stage, or moves a run out of one: it closes a run after
# the last leg, and abandons one on the user's word. A run is at most two legs: the last one
# carries it to `shipping` with the ship card, and the postmaster sets `shipped` after the
# merge and `done` when it closes. `review` is entered only by a run with a review leg. A
# run dispatched before this change keeps its three legs and the stages they enter. The actor
# is the caller's own word, so this holds a coachman to its runbook; it cannot stop a process
# that names itself the postmaster.
