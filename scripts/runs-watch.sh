# Wait until a run under a project's run root needs the postmaster, then print runs-status.sh's
# table, name each run that needs it with its NEXT, and exit. This is the loop Stage D keeps in
# the background: it reads runs, sleeps and prints, and nothing else. A session that improvises
# this look loses it on a restart and fires on runs it must leave alone.

#
# It looks at once, then every postmaster.poll_seconds (default 120) from the config
# (POSTMASTER_CONFIG overrides the path). A run needs the postmaster when its NEXT is anything
# but WAIT (a leg at work), USER (already put to the user) or - (closed). A run listed in
# <runs>/postmaster/held, one ticket per line, never does: hold a run by writing its ticket
# there exactly as the RUN column shows it, and release it by removing the line. A held line
# that matches no run warns on stderr. The held list and the config are read on every look,
# so a hold takes effect without restarting the watcher. A missing config, or a poll interval
# that is not usable, gets the default, 120 seconds, which it says; an unset one is silent.
#
# With --timeout, a look that finds nothing for that many seconds prints the table and exits 3;
# the timeout counts the seconds it has slept, so a clock set forward does not end the wait
# early. A count or a timeout is at most 9 digits. Without --timeout it waits until a run needs
# the postmaster.
#
#   exit 0  a run needs the postmaster: the table, then one `needs <run> <NEXT>` line each
#   exit 3  --timeout passed with nothing to act on: the table
#   exit 1  usage, no such root, the held list cannot be read, or a timeout
#           that is not a whole number
#
# Controls: every NEXT that must wake the postmaster names its run on exit 0 (positive), and
# WAIT, USER, -, and a held run leave it waiting until its timeout (negative).
