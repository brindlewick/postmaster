# The turnpikes: the checks a run must pass through before it ships. The project's gate is not
# one of them; it runs on every run. This is the one place the turnpikes and the default set are
# defined. A ticket names its run's turnpikes in its `## Turnpikes` section, and
# scripts/ticket-check.sh, the postmaster and the coachman all read them from here.
#
#   turnpikes.sh --list                 every turnpike, one per line: its name, `default` or `-`,
#                                       the leg that runs it, and what it checks
#   turnpikes.sh resolve [--project <repo>] [<text>...] a `## Turnpikes` section's text, as the turnpikes it
#                                       names; with no text given, the section is read from stdin
#   turnpikes.sh legs <dispatch> [--expect <line>]
#                                       a run's legs, from the `turnpikes:` line under its
#                                       waybill's title; with --expect, that line must be <line>
#   turnpikes.sh legs --line <line>     the legs a waybill with that `turnpikes:` line would have
#   turnpikes.sh short <line>           the default turnpikes a `turnpikes:` line leaves out
#   turnpikes.sh --self-test
#
# A section holds `default`, `none`, or turnpike names, separated by commas or spaces, and
# nothing else. `default` stands for the project's configured default turnpikes, or every
# turnpike --list marks default when the project has not declared its own;
# `none` stands alone. Case, backticks, a list marker at the start of a line, a thematic break,
# a hard line break, invisible characters and a closing full stop are ignored; every other
# token, a lone dash or dots among them, is a word, and a word that is not a turnpike is named.
# resolve prints the line the waybill carries: `turnpikes: ` and the names, in the order --list
# gives them, or `turnpikes: none`.
#
# legs prints one line per leg the run has, in order: its number, its name, and the turnpikes it
# runs. Synthesis (1) and ship (3) always run. Review (2) runs only when the waybill names a
# turnpike that runs in it, so a run with none goes from synthesis to ship. The waybill's line
# is the one `turnpikes:` line between its title and its first `##` heading, above the ticket,
# so nothing the ticket holds is ever read for it. It holds the names resolve printed, or
# `none`, never `default`. A waybill with no such line is refused, never read as `none`.
#
# A turnpike is added as one line of the table below, and to the runbook step that runs it.
# Every command checks the table first: each name a lowercase word, neither `default` nor
# `none`, listed once; `default` or `-`; a leg that exists; and words saying what it checks.
