#
#   round    the round that just finished, a whole number from 1 to 3
#
# Reads <dispatch>/actions.jsonl. A finding is a `finding` line whose detail opens with its class,
# `gating` or `style`, then its severity (P1, P2 or P3), its round (r1, r2, ...) and the rest. An
# apply is an `apply` line whose detail names the finding targets it fixes; it counts for round r
# when any target it names has a finding of round r. A target's latest finding line counts, so a
# fix that does not verify closed, logged again in the round that checked it, is that round's.
#
# The rule (ticket #80, the user's of 2026-09-27): round 2 runs whenever round 1 applied a fix;
# after that, round r+1 runs only when round r logged a verified P1 or P2 finding. The cap of three
# rounds stays as a backstop: when round 3 logs a verified P1 or P2 finding the loop stops and
# escalates with the residue.
#
# Prints one decision line:
#   RUN <next>: <reason>
#   STOP <round>: <reason>
#   CAP 3: <reason>; escalate with residue
#
#   exit 0  the decision is printed
#   exit 1  usage, a round past 3 or below 1, a missing or unreadable action log, a finding whose
#           detail does not open with its class, or a finding with no readable severity or round
