#   target   what the action was done to: a lane, a ticket id, a branch, a path, a round
#   detail   free text; everything after the target, joined by spaces. A finding's opens with its
#            class, gating or style, so the style findings can be told apart. A spec-review's
#            opens with the decision, approved, changes or dropped, then the spec commit the
#            user saw, then the user's words where the decision is changes or dropped
#
# A tool-fault is postmaster itself misbehaving: a script, a runbook step or a harness adapter.
# Its target is the postmaster file, relative to the checkout this script is in or absolute,
# and is recorded as its real path relative to that checkout. Its fields are flags, all
# required but --workaround and --control, and the line carries them as a `fault` object, with
# --failed as its detail. A script skills/postmaster/controls.md lists is a control of the kind
# the list gives, whatever --control says; --control gives the kind of a step the list names.
# A fault in a control is recorded as one, and the message says to stop.
#
# Every field is written as JSON that any reader can split on newlines: a control character is
# dropped, bytes that are not UTF-8 are dropped, and a line or paragraph separator is escaped.
#
# Writes one JSON line to <dispatch>/actions.jsonl and the same line, with the run named, to
# <dispatch>/../ledger.jsonl (the project's ledger across runs, under the project's own
# .postmaster/runs/). Both are append-only. Nothing in the flow reads its own narrative back
# to learn from it; it reads these lines.
#
# The run is the dispatch directory's name. The project is the basename of the project root:
# <project>/.postmaster/runs/<TICKET>, so two projects with the same basename keep separate
# ledgers. An older layout, runs/<project>/<TICKET>, is still read as that project.
#
#   exit 0  written to both files
#   exit 1  usage, an action outside the set, a finding with no class, a tool-fault missing a
#           field or naming no postmaster file, or a file could not be appended
