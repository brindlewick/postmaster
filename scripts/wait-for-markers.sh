# Control: before polling, the reader is proved both ways through the identical find. It must
# count a marker this script plants (positive control) and count zero for a pattern that cannot
# match (negative control). A poller that can only ever say 0 is indistinguishable from lanes
# that are still working, so it reads as patience rather than as a broken instrument.
