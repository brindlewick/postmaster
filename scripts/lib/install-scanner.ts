// Socket's install scan behind the shape Bun loads, composed with a recorded
// verdict for tests. Installs run Socket's module directly (bunfig.toml),
// which Bun bootstraps on a fresh clone where a wrapper importing a package
// that is not installed yet cannot load; refresh-parser scans through this
// module, so it can prove the scan against a fixture, and #424 extends this
// module into the joined install check.
//
// POSTMASTER_SCAN_FIXTURE names the recorded verdict, JSON of the shape
// { error?: string, advisories?: { "<name>@<version>": Advisory[] } }: an
// error throws as if the scanner were unreachable, else the recorded
// advisories answer for each scanned package. Unset everywhere else, where
// the scan goes to Socket (free mode without SOCKET_API_TOKEN). Anything
// the scan cannot check throws, and Bun cancels the install.
