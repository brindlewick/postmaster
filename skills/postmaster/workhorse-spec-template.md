# Workhorse spec template

A workhorse copies the block below to `WORKHORSE-SPEC.md` at its worktree root, fills it in, and commits
it on its own before writing any code. The format is adapted from GitHub Spec Kit's plan and
tasks templates, in one file.

```markdown
# Workhorse spec: <ticket id> <ticket title>

## Summary

<The ticket's requirement in one sentence, and the approach this workhorse will take.>

## Technical context

<Only the lines that apply.>

- **Language and version**:
- **Dependencies used or added**:
- **Testing**: <the commands that will show each acceptance criterion is met>
- **Constraints**: <from the ticket's direction and the project's own rules>

## Direction check

<Each constraint in the ticket's direction and in the project's own rules (its AGENTS.md or
equivalent), and how this plan meets it. A departure goes in the table under Complexity
tracking.>

## Structure

<The files and directories this workhorse will create or change.>

## Complexity tracking

<Only if the direction check has a departure.>

| Departure | Why needed | Simpler alternative rejected because |
|---|---|---|

## Decisions

<Each choice the ticket left open, and what this workhorse chose. There is no one to ask during
the run: decide, and record it here.>

## Tasks

Format: `- [ ] T<n> [P] [AC<n>] <description, with exact file paths>`.
`[P]` marks a task that depends on no other. `[AC<n>]` names the acceptance criterion the
task serves. Every acceptance criterion has at least one task.

- [ ] T001 [AC1] <description>
```

Tasks may be ticked in later commits as they are done. A task dropped or added along the way
is noted in `WORKHORSE-SUMMARY.md`. The commit that first adds `WORKHORSE-SPEC.md` is the record of intent
and is not rewritten.
