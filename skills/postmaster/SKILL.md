# /postmaster: start work with postmaster

You get the machine ready if it is not, choose a target, confirm a launch card, and start the
postmaster. When the decision script says `self`, that is you: carry on in this conversation
from `postmaster.md` beside this file. When it says `spawn`, start a separate postmaster
session, hand over, report where to watch it, and stop.

The postmaster dispatches one **coachman** per ticket, one leg at a time. A coachman drives
exactly one leg of one load and hands off to the next leg in writing; its runbook is
`coachman.md`. Harness-specific invocations are in `harnesses.md`, tracker mechanics in
`trackers.md`, where a launch runs and how the user watches it in `hosts.md`, and the machine's choices — which harnesses, which lanes, which tracker — in
`~/.postmaster/config.toml`, whose shape is `<tool>/config.example.toml`. There is
no separate per-ticket skill: dispatching a coachman is something the postmaster does, not
something a person invokes.

## First: find the postmaster repo

`<tool>` in these runbooks is the postmaster repo this skill lives in. The skill is installed as
a link into it, never as a copy. Find it once, from `<skill>`: the absolute path of the directory
your harness loaded this file from, or `skills/postmaster` when `AGENTS.md` sent a session in
the repo here.

Resolve it with `realpath "<skill>/../.."`, and check that the result holds an executable
`<tool>/scripts/run`. It prints `<tool>`. Write that absolute path wherever these runbooks say
`<tool>`, and give it to every session you brief. If there is no such `<tool>/scripts/run`, stop and
tell the user: the skill was copied, or its link points somewhere else.
`<checkout>/scripts/run link-skills`, where `<checkout>` is their postmaster checkout, links it
again.

[Why a skill is a link, and the repo is found from it](../../wiki/concepts/skill-links.md)

## Next: establish the preconditions yourself

You are reached two ways, and they arrive in different states. A session opened in this repo
comes through `AGENTS.md`, which may already have set the machine up and chosen a target.
Someone typing `/postmaster` arrives cold. **Assume neither. Check.**

Read `~/.postmaster/config.toml` with your file-reading tools — a missing file means the
machine is not set up — then:

```sh
<tool>/scripts/run link-skills --check
```

Report the link check with the config status. It names every missing or blocked link and
prints the install command, `<tool>/scripts/run link-skills`; the check never installs or
changes anything. Keep installation on the user's word. When links are missing and the config
is present, offer that command; for a missing config, follow the setup section of
`<tool>/AGENTS.md`.

**No config: stop and set the machine up first**, in conversation, per the setup section of
`<tool>/AGENTS.md`; each path there is relative to `<tool>`. Do not continue to target
selection: every later step reads the config for the team, the tracker and the merge word,
and without it the launch card cannot be filled. Come back here when it is written.

**Config present, and this session has already chosen and verified a target:** skip to
"Work out what the project needs" and do not ask again.

**Config present, no target yet:** carry on below.

Say which of these you found, in one line, before doing anything else — including any
missing skill links.
A session that cannot tell whether it is setting up or dispatching is one nobody can follow.

## Choose the target project

**Ask the user which project to dispatch against, whatever the cwd.** The cwd may be `<tool>`
itself or any other project, and neither is the target until the user says so. Do the finding
for them:

```sh
<tool>/scripts/run find-projects [root ...]   # most recently worked first; ~/Code unless roots are given
```

**Sort by last commit and show about twelve.** Recency is the best available proxy for
intent, and it does the filtering that rules cannot: dormant repos and scratch work fall
off the list without needing to be named. Offer the full list on request.

**Exclude third-party clones** (`external/` or wherever they live). Nobody dispatches work
into a vendored copy of someone else's project.

**Do NOT filter to projects with a remote.** Plenty of real work is local-only, and
filtering on a remote silently hides it. Show the remote status as information. Determine the
landing route from the project's instructions: whether it uses pull requests, and which default
branch they target. If the project does not say, ask the user before dispatch. A remote by
itself does not decide the route.

Adjust the search roots to the machine. `~/Code` is one convention, not a rule.

## Precondition: verify the chosen target, and fail if it does not hold

**The chosen project must be a git repository.**

```sh
<tool>/scripts/run check-target <target>   # 0 usable · 1 not a repo · 2 dirty, ask first
```

**Read its exit code and stop on 1.** Do not offer to `git init`, do not walk up looking for
a repo, and do not proceed in a directory that merely contains one. A postmaster with no
repository has nothing to dispatch against, and every later stage (worktrees, gates,
merges) fails in a more confusing way further in.

## A dirty tree is a question, not a failure

Exit 2 from the check means uncommitted work. Coachmen branch from committed HEAD, so
uncommitted work is silently excluded from every run and the user does not find out
until something ships without it. Say what is uncommitted and offer, in this order:

1. **Commit it**: finished work that belongs in the base.
2. **Stash it**: unrelated to this stream. The stash is a shared stack, so name what you
   pushed and where it can be found again.
3. **Commit it to a base branch and dispatch from there**: when the uncommitted work IS
   the starting point.
4. **Hand back**: when none of those is obviously right.

Never choose silently, and never `git checkout`, reset or discard anything.

## Work out what the project needs: discover, do not demand

The flow is general and carries no assumptions about build tools, docs layout or trackers.
**Discover them; only ask when discovery genuinely fails.** A general tool that needs a
config file before it runs on a plain git repo is a tool nobody adopts.

```sh
<tool>/scripts/run discover-project <target>   # gate=… docs=… tracker=… tracker_prefix=… ambient_context=… check.<name>=…
<tool>/scripts/run project-settings inspect <target> # optional project facts and their source
```

The target's tracker is the kind `tracker` names: `local` when the target's own ticket store
exists, whatever the config names, and the config's kind otherwise (`trackers.md`, local).
A github tracker needs the target's board: `<tool>/scripts/run github <target> board` names it, and
exit 3 means there is none yet, so propose `board init` to the user and hand them the URL
it prints. A plane tracker needs the target's project identifier: the discovered
`tracker_prefix` when the target has shipped a ticket, otherwise `<tool>/scripts/run plane projects`
lists the candidates and the user picks. A local tracker needs its store: exit 3 from
`<tool>/scripts/run local <target> store` means there is none yet, so propose `store init` to the
user. A github target with no origin remote can have no board, and `run discover-project` warns
of it: propose `<tool>/scripts/run local <target> store init` to the user instead. Report what
you found on the launch card, and ask only about what you could not determine.
**If the project has no `AGENTS.md` or equivalent, say so.** Lanes that read no ambient
context start blind, and that has silently handicapped a lane before. Ask the user for
the project's risk surfaces (what it binds, allowlists, spawns and serves) where the docs do
not say; the security lens reviews against them.

### Optional project settings

`.postmaster/project.toml` is the one shared file a project may choose to commit. It can declare
what `default` means for its tickets, the tracker binding by name, risk surfaces, and checks. It
cannot assign roles or name credentials, machine paths or machines. `.postmaster/settings.toml`
holds this person's choices on this checkout, including which machine-defined lanes fill local
roles. It cannot set harnesses, models, env files, credentials or paths. Both are optional; a
missing file is normal and is never a reason to create an empty one or pause discovery.

Follow the resolved values and source labels from `run discover-project` and
`run project-settings inspect` when composing the launch card and waybill. Mark each fact as
discovered, shared or local. A ticket still names its own turnpikes: project settings define only
the meaning of `default`.

When the conversation settles a project decision that should stay on this checkout, offer
`.postmaster/settings.toml` and show its contents before writing it. When maintainers should set
the same requirement for everyone, offer `.postmaster/project.toml` instead and say that is the
shared file being proposed. Wait for agreement, then write the agreed file with
`<tool>/scripts/run project-settings write <target> local <file>` or `project <file>`.
The script validates the file and keeps `.postmaster/` ignored. A shared file is ignored by
default too; commit only that file deliberately with `git add -f .postmaster/project.toml`.
Never put paths or credentials in either file.

## Stage 0: scope, confirm, start

1. **Scope the stream.** From the user's words plus a read-only pass over the named
   sources, write one paragraph: what the stream is, its likely first few tickets, and
   which parts of the project they touch. Do not deep-dive; the postmaster does that.
2. **Work with no ticket gets one created first**, in the project's own tracker
   (`trackers.md`).
3. **Decide who runs the stream.** Report what this session is — its harness, its model, its
   absolute working directory, and whether a person is at the terminal — and ask the script. Report
   `yes` only when this conversation can ask a person and receive answers; a headless
   session reports `no`. Do not copy the configured harness or model into the report.

   ```sh
   <tool>/scripts/run front-door "<harness>" "<model>" "<cwd>" <yes|no> <target>
   ```

   It prints `self` or `spawn` with every reason a separate session is needed. `self` means
   this session is already on `team.postmaster`'s harness and model, in the target repo,
   with the user at the terminal: the postmaster is this session, and no second one is
   started. `spawn` means a separate postmaster session is needed, and the reasons say
   which conditions failed: the harness or the model differs from `team.postmaster`, the
   target is another repo, or nobody is at the terminal. When the decision is `spawn` and the
   target is a fixture copy (`run fixture new` marked it), it also prints `headless`: that
   postmaster starts headless on every host, in the form `hosts.md` gives under none, so it
   never meets a trust prompt. `self` stays `self` in a fixture copy. If it exits non-zero instead,
   stop and tell the user what it said: the config is missing, does not parse, or has no
   `team.postmaster`, or the report was malformed. Settle that first; there is no route
   to put on the launch card until the script answers.
4. **Launch card**: one self-contained confirmation covering whether the postmaster is this
   session or a new one, whether it runs headless (the script's `headless` line), with every
   reason the script printed, the postmaster's harness,
   model and effort (`team.postmaster` in the config), the team the config names, whether
   lanes will run confined (top-level `confine` in the config; a missing key means `off`;
   recorded but not yet enforced, until launch reads the key in #200), who says
   the merge word for local-merge projects (`ship.merge_authority`), the landing route
   (`pull-request` or `local`), the session host the fleet will run on
   (`<tool>/scripts/run host detect`), and the project facts above. Launch nothing before the user
   picks.
5. **Create the project-local run root** and keep what the call prints for the steps below.
   The project path, not its basename, identifies this run root:

   ```sh
   <tool>/scripts/run project-settings run-root <target>
   ```

   It creates `<target root>/.postmaster/runs/postmaster` and the folder's ignore rule, and
   prints `<target root>/.postmaster/runs`. `<tool>/scripts/run log-action` needs the directory
   to exist, so the postmaster's own actions go under `<runs>/postmaster/`. Log from your first
   action there. A postmaster that is this session keeps the same records as one you spawn. The
   call never creates settings. A run already in flight under the old
   `~/.postmaster/runs/<basename>/` layout is not migrated.
6. **Write the brief** to `<runs>/postmaster/brief.md`: "You are the postmaster for <project>.
   Read `<tool>/skills/postmaster/postmaster.md` first", then the stream paragraph, the project
   profile, the configured team, who says the merge word, the session host, `<tool>` and the
   config path, plus this session's report and the route result, and, when the route says
   `headless` or the host is none, that it runs headless and writes
   `<runs>/postmaster/ESCALATION.md` when it needs the user.
   It is what you settled here,
   and what a postmaster restarted from nothing reads to carry on. Then log the first action:

   ```sh
   <tool>/scripts/run log-action <runs>/postmaster postmaster note launch "<route result>"
   ```

7. **`self`: carry on as the postmaster.** Read `<tool>/skills/postmaster/postmaster.md` and
   run the stream in this conversation. Log every action through `run log-action` under
   `<runs>/postmaster/`, as that runbook says. Do not start a second session.
8. **`spawn`: start a new postmaster session.** If the route has a `headless` line, use the
   headless form from `hosts.md` through `run host run` on every host. It starts the configured
   harness headless with the brief as its prompt, writes events and errors under
   `<runs>/postmaster/`, and has no terminal to stop at a question:

   ```sh
   <tool>/scripts/run host run "postmaster" <target root> --out <runs>/postmaster/events.jsonl \
     --err <runs>/postmaster/postmaster.err --marker <runs>/postmaster/.exited -- \
     <tool>/scripts/run launch launch postmaster <target root> <runs>/postmaster/brief.md
   ```

   That form needs a harness with a resume form (`hosts.md`, none), so the user can answer an
   escalation by resuming it. When the route has a `headless` line and `team.postmaster` names
   a harness with none, run the postmaster on another harness that has one, as `hosts.md` says,
   and never fall back to interactive for a marked fixture. Without a `headless` line, start an
   interactive session of the postmaster's harness (`team.postmaster` in the config), rooted in
   the target repo, in the harness's interactive form from `harnesses.md`: its bypass mode, named
   `postmaster`. Hand it a
   one-line prompt file that says to read the brief at `<runs>/postmaster/brief.md` first:

   ```sh
   <tool>/scripts/run host spawn postmaster-<project> <repo> --label "postmaster" -- <interactive form>
   <tool>/scripts/run host send postmaster-<project> <prompt-file>
   <tool>/scripts/run host read postmaster-<project>      # it took the message: a new session can drop one
   ```

   On Herdr it opens as a tab in the target repo's space, the root of every run's tree; on tmux,
   as a window in session `postmaster-<project>`. If `spawn` says it is not ready, the harness is
   asking something on its first start there, such as claude asking whether to trust the folder:
   the user answers it in the pane, and then the prompt is sent. For an ordinary `spawn` with no
   host, `spawn` exits 3: launch it headless as `hosts.md` gives under none, with a line in its
   brief that it runs headless, so whenever it needs the user it writes
   `<runs>/postmaster/ESCALATION.md` and ends its turn; tell the user it answers by resume.
9. **Report**. `self`: say that you are the postmaster and the stream is running here. `spawn`:
   say where to watch it (the space and tab, the tmux session, or with no host its events
   file), the run root, and the brief, then stop.

## The waybill

The postmaster writes one per ticket at `<repo>/.postmaster/runs/<TICKET>/brief.md`.
It is the only thing that travels between the postmaster and a coachman, so it carries
everything the coachman needs and nothing it must go and find:

```
# Waybill: <TICKET>
<the turnpikes: line <tool>/scripts/run ticket-check printed for the ticket, whole: turnpikes: <names> or turnpikes: none>

## Ticket
<the ticket verbatim: problem, acceptance criteria, direction, turnpikes, notes, User journey if it has one>

## Project profile
repo: <abs path>          default branch: <name>       BASE: <sha>
gate: <the real command>  build: <the real command>    browser suite: <command or none>
landing: pull-request | local   (whether the postmaster opens a pull request or merges on the word)
docs to read first: <files, in order>
tracker: <kind, and how a ticket is read and written>
risk surfaces: <what the project binds, allowlists, spawns, serves; from its docs or the user>
checks: <as `run verify record` printed them: each check's name, where it came from, its command and what it shows>

## Team
workhorses: <lane>=<harness>/<model>/<effort>, <lane>=…
reviewers: <lane>, <lane>
bug reviewers: <lane>, <lane>             (always; only the chosen bug reviewers whose harness has a code-review form, which is the bug lens's whole team)
<lens> reviewers: <lane>, <lane>          (one line for each lens the config gives its own lanes)
coachman: <harness>/<model>/<effort>      (never a lane's model)
efforts: <name>=<effort>, <name>=<effort>, …   (pasted whole from the line `<tool>/scripts/run run-meta efforts <dispatch>` printed: every lane and coachman role that has an effort, a per-leg coachman as coachman.<leg>; the postmaster is left out)
CHECKPOINT_MODE comes from ship.checkpoint_mode; MERGE_AUTHORITY for local merges comes from ship.merge_authority; override either only where the user says so for this run

## Dispatch
name: <ticket id>, <ticket title>
dispatch: <abs path of this directory>
synthesis worktree: <abs path; cut by the postmaster at BASE, the coachman's cwd for every leg>
tool: <abs path of the run's pinned postmaster checkout, at the dispatch commit: <tool> in the coachman's runbook>
postmaster ruling channel: resume the coachman's thread (harnesses.md) with the ruling as the prompt
coachman contract fixture: pending (the postmaster sets yes or no at the final card)
contract fixture check: - (the postmaster records the command, commit and score at the final card)
```

The postmaster's own session continues to use the main checkout it found from the skill. The
waybill's `tool:` path is the run's pinned checkout; coachman launches, resumes and takeovers
use that path for their host, launch and runbook files. An older waybill keeps the tool path it
already names.

## Hard rules

- You run the stream only as the postmaster, and only when `<tool>/scripts/run front-door`
  says `self`. A `spawn` means hand over and stop. Either way the postmaster's job is
  `postmaster.md`.
- The postmaster runs no model lanes and edits no source. Its tokens buy judgment:
  decomposition, dispatch, supervision, escalation, merge grants, and talking to the
  user.
- All work in worktrees; the project's default branch stays clean.
- Verify claims against code before trusting them, above all before granting a merge.
- Every action on a project is logged as it happens, through `<tool>/scripts/run log-action`, by
  the postmaster and by every coachman. The narrative is for reading; the log is for
  learning.
- Prefer a script to a hand-rolled step. Anything deterministic (drift checks, collision
  surfaces, gate runs, completion detection) belongs in a script, not in prose that a
  model re-derives every run.
