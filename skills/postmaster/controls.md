# Controls

A control is a part of postmaster that decides whether something was checked: a check, the
gate, a marker, a wait, or the action log. This file is the one list of them. The runbooks
read it to know which faults stop a leg; `scripts/log-action.sh` and `scripts/tool-faults.sh`
read its tables.

A fault in a control stops the leg and goes to the user, and is never worked around. A fault
in any other part of postmaster may be worked around, and the workaround is logged with the
fault (`coachman.md`, Tool faults).
[Why faults become tickets, and why a control is never worked around](../../wiki/concepts/tool-faults.md)

## Scripts

A fault in one of these is a fault in a control, whatever the step that ran it.

| part | kind | what it decides |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/ticket-check.sh` | check | a ticket has its shape before it is accepted or dispatched |
| `scripts/check-target.sh` | check | the target is a clean git repository before anything is cut from it |
| `scripts/handoff-check.sh` | check | a leg ends only on a complete hand-off |
| `scripts/wiki-lint.sh` | check | the wiki's citations, links and standings hold |
| `scripts/discover-project.sh` | gate | which command is the project's gate |
| `scripts/wait-for-markers.sh` | wait | a round is collected only when every marker is in |
| `scripts/runs-status.sh` | marker | what the postmaster's poll reads from each run's markers |
| `scripts/log-action.sh` | action-log | every action is recorded as it happens |
| `scripts/stage.sh` | action-log | every stage change is recorded, and the run is timed from the record |
| `scripts/run-meta.sh` | action-log | what a run started from |
| `scripts/tool-faults.sh` | action-log | every fault a run met reaches a ticket or the run's records |

## Runbook steps

A fault in one of these names its runbook as the file, the step in `--ran`, and the kind in
`--control`.

| step | kind |
|---|---|
| `coachman.md`: the blind acceptance tests, and running them on each lane | check |
| `coachman.md`: verifying a workhorse's claims, and a reviewer's findings, against the code | check |
| `coachman.md`: the scratch assert, and the integrity check after each round | check |
| `coachman.md`: classifying a lane REVIEWED or DEGRADED | check |
| `coachman.md`: running the project's gate, unpiped | gate |
| `postmaster.md`: Stage F, verifying the card against the code | gate |
| `coachman.md`, `postmaster.md`: touching or reading a marker | marker |
| `coachman.md`: the wait in the same command as the launch, and the stall cutoffs | wait |
| `coachman.md`, `postmaster.md`: a `log-action.sh` line a step writes | action-log |
