# Oracle for #158: blind acceptance tests for criterion 5 at the ticket's own interface.
#
# Written by the leg-1 coachman after the ticket gained criterion 5 (a lint rule run by
# Oxlint on Bun) and before any lane implemented anything: no lane diff existed when this
# was written. It checks only what the ticket names: Oxlint run on Bun with the project's
# `.oxlintrc.json` passes a test file beside its target, and fails one with no sibling
# target or one sitting in a separate test folder. It asserts behavior only (exit status
# and the file named in the output), never rule names, messages, or config internals,
# which are the implementation's choice.
#
#   oracle-158.sh           run from the repo root; exit 0 when the worktree meets
#                           criterion 5, 1 otherwise, one line per probe
#
# BASE calibration (73fca4e): 0/4 pass; P0 fails (no `.oxlintrc.json`) and P1-P3 fail
# with it. A lane passes a probe only by implementing the ticket. Validated to 4/4
# against a trial rule in scratch through the identical command.
#
# Deferred to synthesis against the decided contract (the script's CLI spelling, the
# SHARES line layout and the shares.json field names are the implementation's choice
# per the approved spec, so no blind fixture can invoke them): criteria 1-4, by reading
# each lane's diff and executing each lane's own controls at harvest.
