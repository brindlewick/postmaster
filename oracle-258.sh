# Oracle for #258: blind acceptance tests at the ticket's own interface.
#
# Written from the ticket's checks C1-C12 before any lane's diff, committed on
# the ticket branch, and run against each lane's work at harvest by cherry-picking
# this commit onto a scratch of the lane. Every test uses only what the ticket
# names - files, commands and their output - never a function shape the lanes
# chose. Three checks have no oracle coverage: C1 on macOS needs a Mac, the
# skip-list entry shape (C2) and the landing question's invocation (C9, C10) are
# the lanes' to choose. Those are verified by execution and reading at harvest.
