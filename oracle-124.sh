# Oracle for #124: blind acceptance tests at the ticket's own interface.
#
# Written by the leg-1 coachman before reading any lane's diff, committed as the
# first commit on the ticket branch. The legs-output expectations are the blind
# part. The dispatch fixtures were updated at synthesis to the decided run
# format both lanes converged on (an explicit new-run marker, absent on runs
# dispatched before the change); the synthesis took run.json coachman_contract.
# The legs --line cases need no fixture and are format-independent.
#
#   oracle-124.sh            run from the repo root; exit 0 when the worktree's
#                            script meets the ticket, 1 otherwise
