# postmaster

**This file is the canonical context for every agent working in this repo, whatever harness
it runs under.** `CLAUDE.md` imports it; codex, grok and pi read it natively; agy and muse
read no ambient file at all and must be pointed at it explicitly by whatever brief launches
them.

## Read this first: this repo is the tool, and it can be its own target

postmaster dispatches agents at git repositories. **One of those repositories may be this
one.** Using postmaster to develop postmaster is supported, and it is the most honest test
the tool has: a flow that cannot improve itself is a flow nobody should trust with a real
project.

A session opening here is usually here to **run** the tool against something else. Ask which
target the operator wants before assuming either way.

### What is different when the target IS this repo

**A run in flight does not see your edits.** A coachman loaded its runbook when it started;
changing `coachman.md` mid-run changes nothing for it. That is a safety property, not a
limitation: a broken edit cannot break a fleet that is already moving. It also means a fix
you just merged is not in effect until the next dispatch.

**The supervising session is in the same position.** Whatever is supervising loaded its
context at startup. After merging a change to the flow, restart it or accept that it is
running the previous version.

**Everything else is ordinary.** Worktrees under `.worktrees/` are gitignored, the gate runs
the same way, and merges are merges. There is no special mode.

### The one thing that genuinely bites

**Do not let a run rewrite the file that a live run is mid-way through executing and then
expect either to be coherent.** If a ticket changes the coachman contract (markers, the
waybill shape, completion detection), land it while the fleet is idle, or the next dispatch
will read a new contract while an older run is still writing to the old one.

Contract changes are the only category that needs the fleet quiet. Ordinary changes to
scripts, docs and prose do not.

## When a session opens in this repo, do this

No slash command, and no wizard for the operator to run. They open their agent in this
folder and this file takes it from there: set the machine up if it is not, choose a target,
launch the postmaster. Work out where the operator is and pick up from there.

**1. Is this machine set up?**

```sh
cat ~/.postmaster/config.toml 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT SET UP"
```

If it is missing, set it up now, in conversation, before anything else. You conduct it:
probe first, ask one thing at a time, verify each answer, then have the script write the
config. Do not guess an answer, and do not hand the operator a script to run instead.

```sh
scripts/probe-harnesses.sh     # which agent CLIs exist, and which read no ambient context
scripts/probe-trackers.sh      # which ticket sources are reachable, and what would finish each
```

What to settle, in this order, and why none of it is guessed:

- **Which harness and model fills each role:** the horses, the reviewers, the coachman and
  its fallback, the postmaster. Offer only what the probe found, and do not assume: a
  harness on PATH can still be walled, out of credit, or reading no ambient context. The
  shape of the answer is `config.example.toml` at the repo root.
- **How tickets are created.** GitHub Issues on a GitHub Projects board is the default: a
  kanban the operator can open, needing only `gh` logged in with the `project` scope. When
  the probe says `partial`, it names the one command that finishes it (`gh auth login`,
  `gh auth refresh -s project`); the operator runs it, since a login is theirs, and you probe
  again. Plane is the other named kind: ask for the API origin and the workspace slug, ask
  the operator to write `~/.postmaster/plane.env` with `PLANE_API_KEY=<key>` themselves,
  since a key never passes through a conversation, and confirm with `scripts/plane.sh
  projects`. Anything else is `other`, described once outside this repo
  (`skills/postmaster/trackers.md`).
- **Where projects live.** `~/Code` is one convention, not a rule.
- **Who says the merge word.** A person, or the postmaster itself (`ship.merge_authority`).
  A run never merges on its own authority; the config says whose authority that is.

Then put the answers in a file, one `key=value` per line, and let the script write and check
the config; it refuses a harness that is not on PATH, a coachman on a lane's model and a
config that does not parse, and a refusal is a question back to the operator, not something
to work around.

```sh
scripts/setup.sh --keys                       # every key, its default and what it asks
scripts/setup.sh --answers <file> --dry-run   # the config it would write
scripts/setup.sh --answers <file>             # write ~/.postmaster/config.toml
```

**2. Which project are we dispatching against?**

```sh
scripts/find-projects.sh                 # most recently worked first
scripts/check-target.sh <chosen>         # 0 usable · 1 not a repo · 2 dirty, ask first
scripts/discover-project.sh <chosen>     # gate command, docs, tracker prefix
```

**The target may be this repo.** Developing postmaster with postmaster is supported; see
the section above for the two things that differ.

**3. Launch the postmaster** per `skills/postmaster/SKILL.md`, and hand over. It checks the
same preconditions again, cheaply, because it is also reached by someone typing `/postmaster`
on a machine that has done none of the above. Tell it what this session has already settled —
the config, the chosen target — and it will pick up from there rather than asking twice.

**Prefer the scripts to doing it by hand.** They are the deterministic half of this flow and
they carry their own controls. Reasoning your way to a project list or a git check is slower,
costs tokens, and is how the wrong answer gets produced confidently.

## What it is

A three-role flow for getting one ticket implemented well by several models at once.

| role | what it does | where it is defined |
|---|---|---|
| **postmaster** | decomposes a stream into tickets, dispatches one coachman per ticket leg by leg, supervises, answers escalations, grants merges | `skills/postmaster/postmaster.md` (spawned by `SKILL.md`) |
| **coachman** | drives one leg of one ticket; five legs, each a fresh coachman with a written hand-off between them, carry a ticket from waybill to ship card: harnessing the team, judging their work, running review rounds, clearing the gate | `skills/postmaster/coachman.md` |
| **the team** | several model lanes implementing the same ticket independently, in **blinkers**: separate worktrees, unable to see each other's work | `coachman.md`, lane table |

The postmaster runs no model lanes and edits no source. A coachman never takes a second
load. The **waybill** (`<dispatch>/brief.md`) is the only thing that travels between them.
Harness-specific invocations live in `skills/postmaster/harnesses.md`, and
`scripts/launch.sh` is their executable form: the runbooks name a form (launch, resume,
thread id), that file gives the command, the script runs it. `SKILL.md` is the front door —
reached from this file or by typing `/postmaster`, it gets the machine ready if it is not and
spawns a postmaster; `postmaster.md` is what that postmaster then does. A run is five coachman
legs, each a fresh thread, so no context outlives a leg and a leg's hand-off document is the
whole of what the next leg knows.

## What the project has learned lives in the wiki

`wiki/` is this project's knowledge base: how harnesses really behave as against their
documentation, what the services the flow depends on actually do, why the design is shaped as
it is, and what happens when several models implement one ticket. `wiki/index.md` is a catalog
of one-line summaries, cheap to read; `wiki/schema.md` is the contract, including who may read
what. `skills/wiki` operates it.

A runbook says what an agent must do. The wiki says what the project knows, what it rests on,
how sure it is and what would change it. Do not restate one in the other.

**Read the index before decomposing a stream into tickets**, and the concepts that stream
touches. **Lanes do not read the wiki**, for the reason `wiki/schema.md` gives: a lane that
has read the project's findings about lanes is no longer an independent measurement of them.

## Vocabulary

Coaching-era, because the shape fits: several horses pull one load, and blinkers stop each
seeing the others. Both are load-bearing properties of the architecture, and no other
metaphor expresses them.

**waybill** the brief that travels with a load · **harness** the CLI wrapping a model ·
**blinkers** worktree isolation between lanes · **lead horse / wheeler** the ranked lanes ·
**turnpike** the gate a run must clear · **remount** resuming a stalled run ·
**spent** a run whose process is gone with no marker · **lame** a lane that is present but not pulling · **fleet** the
whole system.

`orchestrator` is deliberately NOT used: this flow has a postmaster.

## Design rules for the tool itself

1. **Nothing repo-specific.** No hardcoded paths, hosts, trackers, build tools or operator
   names. The flow discovers what a project needs; it does not demand configuration.
2. **Nothing harness-specific in the flow.** Every harness has its own flags and its own
   event format. That belongs behind an adapter (`skills/postmaster/harnesses.md`), not in
   prose telling a reader not to confuse them. Trackers likewise (`skills/postmaster/trackers.md`).
3. **Deterministic work goes in `scripts/`, not in prose.** A check written as prose is
   re-derived, and mis-derived, on every run. A script gets it wrong once and is fixed.
4. **A prompt lives in argv.** Never select a process by matching text that could appear in
   a prompt; match on pid or working directory. Prefer `--prompt-file` where a harness
   offers it.
5. **Every count needs a control.** A positive control reading non-zero and a negative
   control reading zero, through the identical command.
6. **Every action on a project is logged as it happens**, one JSON line per action through
   `scripts/log-action.sh`, per run and per project. The narrative is for reading; the log
   is what a run is audited from and what the flow is improved from.

## Working on this repository

**Fix an open pull request instead of deferring its gaps to a ticket.** When you find a flaw
in work an open pull request introduces, fix it on that pull request's branch: a missing
check, a stale sentence, an instruction with no mechanism behind it, a rule written as prose
that belongs in a script. That does not widen the pull request. Finishing what it introduced
is part of the same change.

A ticket is for work the pull request never set out to do: it touches another contract, needs
the fleet quiet, or depends on something that does not exist yet.

The test is whether the fix completes what the pull request claims. "Is this a separate
concern?" is the wrong test, because nearly anything can be described as one. Before filing a
ticket, run `gh pr list` and check whether the work belongs in one of them.
