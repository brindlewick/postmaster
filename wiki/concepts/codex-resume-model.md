# A resumed codex thread runs on the model its resume names

**Claim.** `codex exec resume` does not restore the model or the effort a thread was launched
on. A resume runs on the model and effort its own command line names. Where it names none, it
runs on codex's configured default, and where the config names none either, on codex's
built-in default. It also prints text unless it is given `--json`, whatever the launch was
given.

**Standing: settled** for codex 0.157.1. A controlled trial launched every thread on one model
and effort, then resumed it with each flag present or absent. It read both the request the
provider received and codex's own record of the turn [@trials/codex-resume-forms]. The
measurement that would refute the claim, a resume that names no model, was made, and the
resumed thread did not keep its model.

## The evidence

Every thread was launched on `launch-model` at effort `high`, and the codex config's default
was `config-model` at `low`. Where a resume named a model or an effort, it was `resume-model`
or `medium` [@trials/codex-resume-forms/results.md].

| the resume named | the resumed turn ran on |
|---|---|
| no model and no effort | `config-model`, `low` |
| no model and no effort, with a config naming neither | `gpt-6-astra`, codex's built-in default |
| `-m resume-model` | `resume-model`, `low` |
| `-c model_reasoning_effort="medium"` | `config-model`, `medium` |
| both, with `--json` and `-o` | `resume-model`, `medium` |

Every resume that ran continued its thread: the same thread id, with the launch's prompt in the
resumed request. Every one exited 0. codex knows what the thread was launched on, and warns
when a resume changes it: "This session was recorded with model `launch-model` but is resuming
with `config-model`" [@trials/codex-resume-forms/part1/bare.md].

The same trial found three more facts about the resume form:

- `codex exec resume` accepts `--json`, `-o`, `-m` and `-c`, placed before or after `resume`.
  With `--json`, a resumed stream has the same event types as a launch's. It refuses `-C` and
  `-s`, exiting 2 with "unexpected argument".
- Without the bypass flag, a resumed turn ran `workspace-write`, not `danger-full-access`.
  `harnesses.md` had said read-only.
- A thread launched in a detached worktree with `--skip-git-repo-check` resumed there without
  it.

## Why it matters

The flow resumes a thread for a remount, a ruling, the merge word and a workhorse's answer.
Before issue #45, `launch.sh` resumed a codex thread with no model and no effort. Through it, a
resumed lane and a resumed coachman leg both ran on the codex config's default
[@trials/codex-resume-forms/part2/before-one.md]
[@trials/codex-resume-forms/part2/before-coachman.md]. That default can be a lane's model, and
a coachman never runs on a lane's model. In the trial, codex's built-in default was
`gpt-6-astra`. That is the model `config.example.toml` gives the codex fallback coachman, so a
resumed codex lane could have run on the coachman's model.

The resumed turn also printed text into a stream the flow reads as JSON.

None of this showed in an exit status. It is the rule that
[prompt delivery](prompt-delivery.md) states: check what the harness received, on its own
record.

## What changed because of it

`skills/postmaster/harnesses.md` records the resume form the trial found, and
`scripts/launch.sh resume` builds it: the launch's flags without `-C`. Through `launch.sh`, a
resumed lane and a resumed coachman leg now run on the model and effort the config names for
them, and write the same events as their launch
[@trials/codex-resume-forms/part2/after-one.md] [@trials/codex-resume-forms/part2/after-coachman.md].
This was issue #45.

## What would overturn it

A codex release that restores a thread's own model on resume. That would not make the form
wrong, since the form names the model either way. Re-running `trial.py` against a new codex
takes about a minute.
