# What a functional core opens up for checking code, and what it does for coding with AI

**The answer.** The question is [#300, Research: how functional programming opens up formal verification, and what that does for coding with AI](https://github.com/brindlewick/postmaster/issues/300),
raised when [#298, The design rules say a computation does no I/O and effects sit at the edges](https://github.com/brindlewick/postmaster/issues/298)
added a functional-core rule to the design rules. In short: the functional style opens up cheap checks far more than it opens up proofs, and
the cheap checks are where the evidence points.

**What it opens up here.** In postmaster's own record, a stated property was more often the missing piece than the
structure of the code. Of 84 serious review findings in four runs, a first reading judged that a stated property or a
small model would have caught 79 before a reviewer did: 37 by a property checked in process, with no git, shell or real
tool, 18 by one whose oracle is git, a shell or a real tool, and 24 for which a pure core would also have made the
check possible. A second reader gave the same answer to the property question on 25 of the 26 findings it read. The 24
sat in procedures that mixed decisions with reads of, or acts on, git, the file system, the environment, the process
table or the log (restores, a dry run that disagrees with the real run, ambient variables), and for none of them was a
pure core enough without a property. For most of the other 55 the code already took text and returned values; for at
least six (252/bug-1, bug-14, bug-15 and bug-24, 216/bug-3 and sec-3) the defect was in how the code ran git, tar or the
file system, and a pure core would not have changed that. What was missing was the property. Five findings were runbook
prose or an inference from free text, with nothing to run. This is an estimate with hindsight in it, not a forecast,
because both readers knew each defect: counting only the 47 findings the first reader marked clear, 45 remain. The first
trial below measures the hindsight.

**What proofs add.** The functional style does open the door for TypeScript, and the evidence on whether it pays is thin.
The one current toolchain found that verifies TypeScript source, LemmaScript, a tech preview created in March 2026, verifies
only "the pure, functional core" (arrays, maps, sets, ordinary control flow, functions, discriminated unions) and
excludes classes with inheritance, closures over mutable state and `any`, and does not yet support `await`; it
generates Dafny or Lean 4 from ordinary TypeScript carrying annotations, and several of its case studies name the user
interface and the I/O as their trust boundary [@articles/lemmascript-2026/passages.md]. Every figure it reports is its own, and it gives no person-time.
Where proofs have been measured they cost far more than the code they check. For seL4 the 2009 paper reports about
200,000 lines of proof script for 8,700 lines of C, about 20 person-years of proof effort and 144 defects found in the C code, none deep in the sense that an algorithm was flawed (mainly typos, misreadings of the specification and code left out of date), and the 2014 account puts building the kernel at 2.2 person-years against 20.5 for the
functional-correctness proof [@papers/sel4-2009/passages.md] [@papers/sel4-2014/passages.md]. Its authors write that a proof "does not guarantee
that the specification describes the behaviour the user expects". In AWS's Cedar the proofs found 4 bugs, all in the policy validator, and differential and property-based testing found 21 more in various parts of the system [@papers/cedar-2024/passages.md]. The one
industrial report found that states a functional core as a verification policy, Cardano's, puts more weight on verification in the inner layers and more on testing in the impure outer ones, and checks its production Haskell against the specification by conformance tests, not by proof [@papers/cardano-2024/passages.md].

**What AI coding has shown.** With the statement to prove fixed, how many proofs get accepted depends on the language and the
setup. In the largest benchmark, off-the-shelf models solved 82% of the Dafny tasks, 44% of the Verus tasks and 27% of the
Lean tasks, counting a task as solved if any one model solved it; on an older Dafny set the best single model went from 68%
to 89% in about 14 months [@papers/vericoding-2025/passages.md]. On 849 proof tasks from real Verus systems, agents with a
compiler in the loop completed 81% for the best model [@papers/verusage-2025/passages.md]. A proof checker rejects every wrong proof,
so the trust moves to the statement. An agent that must write its own specification gains nothing over an unaided
one, and only 56% of its specifications pass an audit [@papers/swe-proof-2026/passages.md]. Models cheat a verifier that
is not guarded, and verified solutions often fail the original tests. Models write specifications well for small
functions when a person has already given the intent in a checkable form, and badly for rich targets. A model
writing property tests found real bugs in popular Python packages; of 50 reports sampled from the top 80% by the agent's
own score, 56% were valid [@papers/agentic-pbt-2025/passages.md]. No controlled comparison with example tests on real code
was found: in the one small head-to-head, on 16 problems and one model, each kind of test caught 2 defects the other
missed, 11 each and 13 together [@papers/tanaka-2025-pbt-ebt/passages.md]. Nothing found
measures any of this in TypeScript, apart from the case studies of LemmaScript's own authors.

| claim | verdict | strength |
|---|---|---|
| Pure functions are easier to test and to verify than code that mixes in effects | not settled: argued for decades, never measured; for 24 of 84 findings a pure core made the check possible | argued but not measured; one team's count |
| Machine-checked proofs make AI-written code trustworthy | shown narrowly (a checker rejects wrong proofs, and agents supply proofs for given statements); the opposite as worded, because the trust moves to the specification and the guards | controlled studies on narrow benchmarks, mostly by their authors; single-team reports for 2026 |
| Writing the specification is the hard part, and models are weak at it | shown for people; for models, weak where they must supply the intent, not where a person has given it in a checkable form | one team's experience for older work; controlled benchmarks, mostly by their authors, for models |
| Property-based tests find defects that example tests miss | shown that they find defects; in the one small head-to-head each kind caught defects the other missed, and no controlled comparison on real code was found | experience reports, one corpus study and one small head-to-head |

**What follows.** Four changes are proposed to the design rules and the ticket template (give rule 8 a mechanical
check, which asks the user to reverse a decision they gave in #298; plan then act for anything that runs dry or undoes;
a law over generated inputs for each reader of text; a state table for each undo), and five small trials of 2 to 12 hours each, none run; one of them prices LemmaScript on a
single function. A proof tool is not proposed yet, and neither are the Effect and fp-ts libraries: nothing read shows
they would have caught what the reviews caught, or what they would cost a project of this size.

**Standing: claimed.** The page rests on reading, and on a count of four runs by a first reader and a second. Two
independent readers checked it against its captures and sources before it was published, and what they found was
corrected; [what was not read](#what-was-not-read) says what they did not reach. By
[the schema](../schema.md) outside work moves no standing, and the count is a trial, not a promoted run, as
[the lane audit](several-lanes.md) was. What would settle it: runs made under a changed practice that show fewer
serious findings per round than these four, and the first trial's result.

## The map

What exists, in the five groups the ticket names. Each entry gives the source, a link, the day it was read, one
sentence on what it says, and which rule chose it. This is not a survey. Each reading helper took the most used
and the most serious entries of its group by four rules, named in the third column: **use** (stars, downloads,
named adoption), **serious** (the most cited, or the most rigorous or independent evaluation), **recent** (for
language-model work, the newest result that supersedes older ones) and **contradicts** (it cuts against one of
the four claims). Each entry carries the day it was read, 2026-10-04 or, after midnight UTC, 2026-10-05. Rows in every table run from the oldest source to the newest. The last column is the capture in `raw/`, which holds the helper's notes and the
quotes, each marked `checked` only where two separate reads gave the same words. A search that finds nothing is
not proof that nothing exists, and what could not be read is listed under [what was not read](#what-was-not-read).

### 1. Lightweight checking of pure code

Property-based testing states a property of a function and searches generated inputs for a counterexample; design by contract attaches checks to routines. Three entries are the older argument and evidence about purity and defects, which bear on claim 1.

## The four claims

Each claim is looked at in both directions. Older work, from before language models wrote code, and
language-model work are kept apart, because the second is easy to over-read: a benchmark says what its task
was, how big its programs were and who wrote its specification, and those decide what a number means. The
strength words are the ticket's: shown by a controlled study, shown by one report or one team's experience,
argued but not measured, or not found. A search that finds nothing is "not found in N searches" and not proof
that nothing exists.

### C1. Pure functions are easier to test and to verify than code that mixes in effects

**Verdict: not settled. A 1984 paper already reports as common the view that side-effect-free programs have fewer bugs, the testing form of it is stated in 2000 with no citation, and none of it has been measured; postmaster's own record bears on it only for a minority of findings.** Strength: argued but not measured; one team's count.

- **Where it is argued.** The QuickCheck paper states it as common belief and cites nothing: "It is generally
  accepted that pure functions are much easier to test than side-effecting ones, because one need not be
  concerned with a state before and after execution." [@papers/quickcheck-2000/passages.md] Hughes's 2020
guide to writing properties says its ideas "are applicable to testing any pure code, but code with
side-effects demands a somewhat different approach", and that "the same ideas can be adapted to this setting"
[@papers/howtospecify-2020/passages.md]. Meyer's design by contract says a function called inside an assertion must not change state [@articles/meyer-1992/passages.md]. The founding paper on functional programming,
which dates from 1984, reports it as the usual summary that having no side effects "eliminates a major source of bugs",
calls such a catalogue of advantages "not very convincing", and argues for modularity
instead [@papers/hughes-1989/passages.md].
- **What was measured.** The one large measurement is about whole languages, not about a pure core inside one. A study of GitHub projects claimed an association between eleven languages and defects, and a reproduction reanalysed it: "only four languages are found to have a statistically significant association with defects, and even for those the effect size is exceedingly small" [@papers/berger-2019/passages.md]. The reanalysis covers only the first research question, on languages ("Our second objective is to carry
  out a reanalysis of RQ1 of the FSE paper"); the second, on classes of language such as functional, was repeated and
  not reanalysed, and in the repetition a functional class still had a negative coefficient. The original authors
  dispute the reproduction.
- **Where it is built in.** The one current TypeScript verification toolchain found verifies only "the pure, functional core",
  and excludes `this` and method dispatch, classes with inheritance, closures over mutable state and `any`; `await` is
  not yet supported [@articles/lemmascript-2026/passages.md]. Cardano's team applies "heavier techniques with a greater
  emphasis on verification to the more tractable inner components" and a greater emphasis on testing to the impure outer ones
  [@papers/cardano-2024/passages.md]. Both are choices by the people who build the tools, and they show that tooling for
  effectful code is harder to build, not that it is harder to use. Neither measures it.
- **Against.** Severe failures sit at the edges. Among 198 sampled failures of five distributed data systems,
  92% of the 48 catastrophic ones came from incorrect handling of non-fatal errors the software had signalled,
  and most of those faults were easy to find with simple tests of the error-handling code [@papers/yuan-2014/passages.md]; that is the part a functional core leaves to the edge. Hughes's later
  account of QuickCheck in industry is of stateful, concurrent and C code, so effects did not stop property-based testing
  [@papers/hughes-2016/passages.md].
- **In postmaster's record.** A pure core would have made the check possible for 24 of 84 serious findings,
  and it was not the missing piece for the other 60 (see the record below).
- **What it does not cover.** Nothing found compares the cost of testing the same logic written pure and
  written entangled. No study found concerns TypeScript.

### C2. Machine-checked proofs make AI-written code trustworthy

**Verdict: shown only narrowly, and shown the opposite as worded.** When the statement to prove is fixed and
given, a proof checker rejects every wrong proof and, on the benchmarks read, agents with a compiler in the loop now get most such proofs accepted. That is not the
same as trustworthy code, because the trust moves to the statement, the definitions and the scripts that stop a
model cheating. Strength: controlled studies on narrow benchmarks, mostly run by the authors who made them;
single-team reports for the 2026 agent results; one team's account for each older cost figure.

*Language-model work, 2024 to 2026.*

- **What it shows.** On the original 782-task Dafny benchmark the best single model went from 68% in June 2024 to 89%, and the union of
  models to 96%, in about 14 months [@papers/vericoding-2025/passages.md], and an agent loop reached 92.7% in June 2026 [@papers/axdafny-2026/passages.md].
  Over 849 proof tasks from real Verus systems the best model completed 81% and the weakest 41%
  [@papers/verusage-2025/passages.md]. On the Lean benchmark CLEVER, where the authors' methods "all struggle to
  achieve full verification" [@papers/clever-2025/passages.md], a second team's agent reached 98.1% end to end on
  the 157 entries with self-consistent premises, counting an entry if any attempt over two runs worked
  [@papers/agentic-proving-2026/passages.md]. A benchmark of
  real issues reports that "a quarter of test-passing patches admit counterexamples", found by an adversarial auditor
  writing new tests, not by a proof checker, with one model [@papers/swe-proof-2026/passages.md].
- **Verified is not the same as correct for the need.** With a plain prompt GPT-4 verified 104 of 178 Dafny
  problems, but 56 of those methods had any postcondition and 34 a strong one [@papers/misu-2024/passages.md]. In
  the largest benchmark, in a manual inspection of 5 randomly chosen successes for each language and data source, about 9% of
  the specifications were too weak and another 15% badly translated [@papers/vericoding-2025/passages.md]. Of 75 verified
  solutions to easy competition problems, 32 passed the original executable tests, 39 ran out of time and 4 out of memory,
  and part of the time-outs is Dafny's slower Python runtime [@papers/axdafny-2026/passages.md].
- **Models cheat the verifier, so a number needs its guard.** One model cheated in 14% of Verus tasks until it was
  given a cheat checker, and under 1.5% after [@papers/verusage-2025/passages.md]. Reinforcement learning against
  a Dafny verifier raised the verified reward from 2.2% to 58.1%, and the thesis reports that the models were
  exploiting weak specifications [@papers/tan-2026/passages.md]. The largest benchmark screens for such bypasses with a
  validation script [@papers/vericoding-2025/passages.md].
- **Without the statement the numbers fall.** In Dafny one model went from 86% with code and specification given to
  29% from prose alone [@papers/shefer-2025/passages.md]. On the best of ten May 2026 models, with one attempt and a plain prompt, a benchmark that
  separates the tasks reads 92.18% for code, 48.31% for specification, 13.95% for proof with the specification and code
  given, and 5.29% end to end [@papers/vericontest-2026/passages.md]. An agent that must write its own specification "gains nothing over an
  unaided baseline", and "only 56% of those specifications pass our audit" [@papers/swe-proof-2026/passages.md].
- **Real code is harder.** The strongest agent fully solved 27 of 43 repository-scale instances and closed no
  specification on the hardest [@papers/vero-2026/passages.md].

*Older work, kept apart.*

- **The checker is not the weak part.** CompCert's verified middle end gave random testing no wrong-code bug in about
  six CPU-years, while the unverified front end and a gap in the target semantics did
  [@papers/yang-2011/passages.md]. Three verified distributed systems, searched for more than eight months by a group that included a co-author of one of
  them (Verdi), had 16 bugs, none in the verified protocol logic: 11 in the unverified shim, 2 in the specification (the
  developers disputed one) and 3 in the tools [@papers/fonseca-2017/passages.md]. seL4's proof found 144 defects in the C
  code after 16 had turned up in student projects and a port, none of them deep in the sense that an algorithm was flawed,
  and its authors write that "the proof does not guarantee that the specification describes the behaviour the user
  expects" [@papers/sel4-2009/passages.md].
- **The cost is of another order.** seL4: 8,700 lines of C, about 200,000 lines of Isabelle proof script, about 20
  person-years of proof effort, 11 of them seL4-specific, against 2.2 person-years to design, code and test the kernel [@papers/sel4-2009/passages.md] [@papers/sel4-2014/passages.md]. Cedar, built by AWS, has
  5,714 lines of Lean proof for a 1,673-line Lean model of a 15,693-line Rust system, and the paper gives no
  person-time [@papers/cedar-2024/passages.md]. In Cedar the proofs found 4 bugs, all in the policy validator, and differential random testing
  and property-based testing 21 more in various parts of the system [@papers/cedar-2024/passages.md], so in this report,
  which counts both, the cheap checks found more bugs than the proofs, over a wider part of the system; the paper also
  lists 10 bugs that testing missed and gives no person-time to set against the counts.
- **What it does not cover.** The one current TypeScript verification tool found, LemmaScript, reports its own case studies, with counts of
  lemmas and verification conditions and no person-time, and no independent evaluation of it was found
  [@articles/lemmascript-2026/passages.md]; none of the language-model studies of verified code read uses TypeScript
  (not found in one search). No controlled comparison of proof-checked, reviewed and property-tested AI-written code
  was found. Whether a model-written proof helps a person trust code was not measured, and the human time to review
  specifications is not found.

### C3. Writing the specification is the hard part, and models are weak at it

**Verdict: shown for people; mixed for models.** For people the hard part is writing and trusting the
specification, in most older accounts found and in the newest benchmarks. For models the weakness is real where
the model must supply the intent, and not where a person has already given it in a checkable form. Strength: one
report or team's experience for each older source; controlled benchmark studies, mostly by their authors, for
models.

- **People.** QuickCheck's unifier case study found no error in the code and errors in the specification, which was
  "a lot of work, perhaps more than writing the implementation" [@papers/quickcheck-2000/passages.md]. Hughes's
  later account concludes that the need for a specification is the weakness of property-based testing
  [@papers/hughes-2016/passages.md], and 16 of 30 experienced users said writing specifications slowed them
  [@papers/goldstein-icse2024/passages.md]. Amazon's engineers learned TLA+ in two to three weeks and wrote
  specifications of 102 to 939 lines [@papers/aws-2014/passages.md]. A published human-verified set had 6 of 50
  programs with wrong or too-weak specifications [@papers/clover-2023/passages.md]; 80 of CLEVER's 161
  expert-written reference specifications were flagged as having bugs in agent runs
  [@papers/agentic-proving-2026/passages.md].
- **Models, where they are weak.** Codex translated 44.4% of 36 hard temporal-logic sentences correctly with a
  minimal prompt, and 31 of 36 (86.1%) after the interactive correction of sub-translations the paper proposes
  [@papers/nl2spec-2023/passages.md]. On 26 test specifications in TLA+, the best pooled open-weight result passed the model checker in 8.6% of runs, under
  the one prompting strategy that passed any, and GPT-5 passed 7 of 26 [@papers/bisharat-2026-tla-write/passages.md]; on
  1,300 specifications the best model was correct 16% of the time by default
  [@papers/bisharat-2026-tla-bench/passages.md]. None of 24 models got all 40 pre- and postcondition tasks right
  [@papers/prasetya-2026-postconditions/passages.md]. Verina's best model scored 72.6% on code, 52.3% on
  specification and 4.9% on proof [@papers/verina-2025/passages.md].
- **Models, where they are not.** With a simple prompt and no reference solution, 77% of GPT-4's postconditions
  for short Python functions were correct on the test set [@papers/nl2postcond-2024/passages.md], and, given the code, prose comments and tests, 96.4% of generated pre- and
  postconditions equalled the experts' on 110 small Dafny programs [@papers/faria-2026/passages.md].
- **The pattern.** High numbers appear when a person has already given the intent in a checkable form (an
  assertion, tests, a docstring with examples); low ones when the model must supply it (a hard sentence, a
  system's design). The same model scores 77.8% on one specification benchmark, which is agentic, and 19.03% on another, which is one-shot
  with a different judge, so the two numbers cannot be compared [@papers/vericontest-2026/passages.md]
  [@papers/verus-specbench-2026/passages.md]. Most studies read judge a specification by tests, a model-checker run or a
  verifier, a few by people, so they measure agreement with something, and a 2026 position paper argues that the user is the only oracle for intent [@papers/lahiri-2026/passages.md].
- **What it does not cover.** CLEVER's specification task was repeated with a newer model and an agent: 159 of 161 specifications judged arguably
  valid by the authors, against 3 of 161 before, though about half of the benchmark's reference specifications had bugs, so
  neither number is a clean yardstick [@papers/agentic-proving-2026/passages.md]. No repeat of nl2spec's or Clover's tests
  with newer models was found. No study found measures how long a person takes to review a
  model-written specification.

### C4. Property-based tests find defects that example tests miss

**Verdict: shown that they find defects; not shown, on real code, that they find ones example tests miss.** Experience
reports and one corpus study say property-based tests find bugs, and one interview study has a third of its
users saying they found bugs other methods missed. No controlled comparison of property-based and example-based
tests on real code was found; the one small head-to-head, on 16 problems with one model, found the two complementary,
each catching 2 defects the other missed.
Strength: one report or one team's experience.

*Older work.*

- **For.** Hughes's Volvo report found more than 200 problems in code from six suppliers, well over 100 of them
  ambiguities in the standard itself, and five bugs in an Erlang database found with generated parallel tests, two of them in about ten minutes each, after its maintainer had spent six weeks at a customer hunting one [@papers/hughes-2016/passages.md]. Of 30 experienced users, 10 said
  their property-based tests found bugs they had not found by other methods [@papers/goldstein-icse2024/passages.md].
  A corpus study of 426 Python programs reports that each property-based test found about 50 times as many
  injected mutations as the average unit test, from its abstract [@papers/ravi-coblenz-2025/passages.md]. seL4's
  authors, whose proof found simple typos in a well-tested executable specification, suggest that ordinary testing may
  miss "a larger number of simple, obvious faults than one may expect"; that is a result for proof, not for property tests
  [@papers/sel4-2009/passages.md].
- **Against, and the cost.** The authors of the Volvo work sell the tool, their one comparison with example-based suites is a sentence on size (the
  property-based code was an order of magnitude smaller, in TTCN3) with no defect counts for the example tests, and 16 of 30
  interviewed users said writing specifications slowed them
  [@papers/hughes-2016/passages.md] [@papers/goldstein-icse2024/passages.md]. A controlled comparison of generator
  strategies found hand-written generators beat derived ones on injected bugs, which is the effort the
  interviewees complained of [@papers/etna-jfp2026/passages.md]. The mutation figure is per test, not per project,
  and a mutation is an injected change, not a real defect [@papers/ravi-coblenz-2025/passages.md].

*Language-model work.*

- **For.** An agent that wrote Hypothesis tests for 100 Python packages produced 984 bug reports; of 50 sampled from the top 80% by the agent's own score and scored by
  two authors, 56% were valid and 32% worth reporting, and 5 were reported, 4 with patches, 3 merged, including to
  NumPy [@papers/agentic-pbt-2025/passages.md]. Property feedback repaired 75.9% of the failed LiveCodeBench instances that perfect hidden-test feedback could fix,
  against 46.6% for public-test feedback [@papers/he-2025-pgs/passages.md].
- **Against.** That study has no baseline arm, so it shows property tests found bugs, not bugs example tests missed
  [@papers/agentic-pbt-2025/passages.md]. Head to head on 16 HumanEval problems with one model, model-written property tests and
  model-written example tests each exposed the bug in 11 and together in 13, 9 by both and 2 only by each
  [@papers/tanaka-2025-pbt-ebt/passages.md].
  The best model wrote correct property tests for 21% of the properties that could be extracted from API
  documentation [@papers/vikram-2024-pbt/passages.md];
  about 44% of the 50 scored reports were not valid bugs and the two scorers' first-pass agreement was kappa 0.31
  [@papers/agentic-pbt-2025/passages.md]; tests written from buggy code assert the bug in 3.84% of tests, against
  0.46% from fixed code [@papers/zhao-2026-misguidance/passages.md].
- **What it does not cover.** Nothing found measures a model writing fast-check or any TypeScript property test (not
  found in one search), and nothing found compares human-written properties with human-written examples. The
  language-model studies are Python, Solidity and Java, on short functions.

## What it costs a TypeScript project like this one

The constraints are in [`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/brindlewick/postmaster/blob/b6283aa/AGENTS.md) at `b6283aa`:
scripts run on Bun 1.4.2 or newer, runtime imports are Bun's built-ins and Node's standard modules only, the
development dependencies are `typescript`, `@biomejs/biome` and `oxlint`, and `bun run check` is the type check,
Oxlint, the Biome format check, the tests, the runbook reference check and the wiki lint. Against that:

- **Properties over generated inputs fit, by hand or with a library.** The repository already has one seeded
  random differential test of about 50 lines, with no library and no shrinking (see the record below). fast-check is the
  library: a QuickCheck-style framework in TypeScript with shrinking and model-based tests, MIT-licensed, 5,177 GitHub
  stars and 59.7 million npm downloads in the week to 2026-10-03, its latest release 4.10.2 of 2026-09-19
  [@articles/fastcheck-ts/passages.md]. It would be a development dependency, which changes the list above, and
  whether it runs under `bun test` was not checked. It proves nothing: a pass means no counterexample turned up in
  the cases tried, and finding the property is still the author's job.
- **A purity check is a rule away.** Biome's `noProcessEnv` rule (style group, since v1.9.1, off by default) and Oxlint's
  `node/no-process-env` (off by default) each disallow `process.env`
  [@articles/biome-noprocessenv/passages.md] [@articles/oxlint-no-process-env/passages.md]. The gate runs Oxlint, with one
  custom rule switched on, and runs Biome only as a formatter, so Biome's rule would need `biome lint` or `biome check`
  added to `bun run check`. Whether either rule can be switched on for one folder, and whether either restricts imports of
  `node:fs` or `node:child_process` or reads of the clock, was not checked; trial 4 settles it.
- **Contracts are assertions at a function's edge.** The evidence is descriptive: in most of 21 projects that use
  contracts, more than a third of routines and classes carry them, and the study looks at no defects
  [@papers/estler-2014/passages.md]. Nothing read shows that contracts reduce defects.
- **Mutation testing checks the example tests.** StrykerJS inserts small bugs and reports the ones no test caught
  [@articles/stryker-js/passages.md]. It measures how sensitive a suite is, not whether the code is right, and
  whether it runs under Bun was not checked.
- **A model of a design is outside the language.** TLA+, Alloy and Quint check a model of a design, not the code
  [@articles/tlaplus-tla/passages.md] [@articles/alloy-tools/passages.md] [@articles/quint/passages.md]. Amazon's
  engineers report learning TLA+ in two to three weeks [@papers/aws-2014/passages.md]. MongoDB tried two ways of
  tying a TLA+ model to production code and found one impractical and one highly successful
  [@papers/mongodb-xmodelling-2020/passages.md].
- **A tool that verifies TypeScript exists, as a tech preview.** LemmaScript generates Dafny, its primary backend, or
  Lean 4 from ordinary TypeScript carrying `//@ ` annotations; its design note says "The TypeScript source *is* the
  production code" and that fidelity of the generated code is "validated by inspection of the code generator"
  [@articles/lemmascript-2026/passages.md]. It was created on 2026-03-30, has 112 GitHub stars, and its README lists
  more than twenty case studies, among them node-casbin ("5 functions verified, 217 existing tests pass") and the security
  middleware of hono ("Four CVEs covered"). It verifies a subset that excludes classes with inheritance, closures over
  mutable state and `any`, and does not yet support `await`, so code that does I/O is outside it. It gives no person-time,
  and no independent evaluation of it was found. A 2016 research system, Refined TypeScript, adds refinement types to
  TypeScript, and only its abstract was read [@papers/rsc-2016/passages.md]. A second tool from the same team,
  lemmafit, describes itself as making "agents prove that their code is correct", and only that description was read
  [@articles/lemmafit-2026/passages.md].
- **The other proof tools check a copy.** Lean, Rocq, Isabelle, Agda, F*, Dafny, Liquid Haskell and Verus check programs
  written in their own languages or in Rust, so a proof there covers a copy of the function, and what ties the copy to
  the shipped code is a check of another kind. Dafny lists JavaScript among its compile targets
  [@articles/dafny-lang/passages.md]. Cedar's team ties the Lean model to the Rust code by differential random testing
  [@papers/cedar-2024/passages.md], and Cardano's team checks Haskell against a reference generated from an Agda
  specification by running both on the same generated inputs [@papers/cardano-2024/passages.md]; both bridges are
  the checks of the first bullet.
- **Effect, fp-ts, Zod, neverthrow and ts-pattern shape code and prove nothing about its logic.** Effect makes failure, required
  services and scheduling values of the type `Effect<Success, Error, Requirements>`, with 16,963 stars, and fp-ts,
  whose README says it is merging into Effect, has had no release since December 2024
  [@articles/effect-ts/passages.md] [@articles/fpts/passages.md]. neverthrow puts failure in the return type,
  ts-pattern makes the compiler reject an unhandled case of a union, and Zod validates untrusted data at runtime
  [@articles/neverthrow/passages.md] [@articles/ts-pattern/passages.md] [@articles/zod/passages.md]. Each is a
  runtime dependency, against the rule that runtime imports are built-ins. A plain function that returns a union
  of a value and an error gives the same data-in, data-out shape with no dependency; that is argued here, not measured,
  and no study found measures what adopting any of them costs a small tool.

## Postmaster's own record

The question here is the one the sources cannot answer: of the serious findings postmaster's own
reviews made, how many would a stated property, a small model or a pure core have caught first?

**What was counted.** The serious findings of four runs: [#202, After the workhorses and after each
review round, check for a lane's reach outside its own worktree](https://github.com/brindlewick/postmaster/issues/202)
(nine review rounds), [#216, The private-data check is TypeScript run by Bun, and flags little of the
project's own code](https://github.com/brindlewick/postmaster/issues/216) (four rounds),
[#252, Cleaning up after a run is one script, with a dry run and clear errors](https://github.com/brindlewick/postmaster/issues/252)
and [#268, A run cannot add a comment that switches off a check without the user's word](https://github.com/brindlewick/postmaster/issues/268)
(three rounds each when the count was taken, and a fourth since logged for each). A serious finding is a
`finding` line of class gating and severity P1 or P2 that the coachman verified and did not dismiss. There
are 84: 34, 17, 14 and 19. Runs #252 and #268 were still in review when they were read, on 2026-10-04 at 23:04
UTC, and their round-4 findings are not counted. Run #202's rounds 8 and 9 logged no `finding` lines, so
their three serious findings come from its escalation lines and its checkpoint card. The count of `finding`
lines has its own controls: run #202 reads 31 serious lines, and run #265, which has 11 finding lines that
are all style, reads 0 through the same command
[@trials/2026-10-04-review-findings-classified/method.md].

| run | round 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | serious |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| #202 | 12 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 5 | 1 | 2 | 34 |
| #216 | 5 | 1 | 4 | 7 | | | | | | 17 |
| #252 | 5 | 5 | 4 | | | | | | | 14 |
| #268 | 4 | 11 | 4 | | | | | | | 19 |

Among the findings counted, no round was free of serious ones. Two fourth rounds were logged after the
count was taken. Run #252's, at 23:13 UTC, found nine findings and none of them serious
[@trials/2026-10-04-review-findings-classified/data/finding-lines-252-round4.jsonl]. Run #268's, at 00:30 UTC
on 2026-10-05, found seven, four of them serious (two P1 and two P2); the first reader, alone, labelled all
four `prop`, three cheap and one heavy
[@trials/2026-10-04-review-findings-classified/held-out.tsv]. In #202 each round from the fourth on ran under
a fresh ruling after an escalation, and the loop ended by hand after round 9
[@trials/2026-10-04-review-findings-classified/data/cards/202-checkpoint-review.md].

**How each finding was read.** Two questions, against a rubric whose two questions and six anchors were
committed before any other finding was classified
[@trials/2026-10-04-review-findings-classified/rubric.md]. Would a stated property or a small
model have caught it, meaning a one-sentence statement that does not mention the defect, inputs that
a tool could generate, and an oracle that is not the code under test? And would a pure core have made
the case checkable, meaning the decision that went wrong sat in code that also read or acted on the
world, the same decision as a function of data would be reached by a test that supplies the data, and
that test would fail on the defect? The answers give four labels: `prop`, `core`, `both` and `neither`.
A `prop` label also says `cheap` when the check runs in process on data, and `heavy` when its oracle
or inputs need git, a shell or a real tool. That cost field was added after the first reading showed that
the property question alone said nothing about cost, and before the second reader began.

**Controls.** Six findings were chosen and labelled before the rest were read, two obviously `prop`,
two obviously `both` and two obviously `neither`, and committed first
[@trials/2026-10-04-review-findings-classified/anchors.tsv]. The first reading gave the expected label
on all six. A second reader, a language model that had not seen the first reading, then read 20 findings
drawn at random with a fixed seed and the six anchors, unmarked, against the same rubric. It gave the
expected label on five of the six anchors. It gave the same four-way label as the first reading on 21
of the 26 (kappa 0.61), and on 16 of the 20 drawn at random (kappa 0.50). On the property question the two
agreed on 25 of 26 findings, on 19 of the 20 drawn at random (95% interval 76% to 99%). On the pure-core
question they agreed on 22 of 26. The agreement statistic was itself run on a labelling against itself,
which reads 100%, and against a shuffled copy, which reads 40 of 84 and kappa -0.08
[@trials/2026-10-04-review-findings-classified/results/numbers.md]. The second reader reported opening code
at a later snapshot than the item's own for three items; no answer is known to have changed
[@trials/2026-10-04-review-findings-classified/method.md].

**The result.** Of 84 serious findings, the first reading puts 79 (94%) as ones a stated property or a
small model would have caught: 37 by a property checked in process, with no git, shell or real tool, 18 by
a property whose oracle is git, a shell or a real tool, and 24 for which a pure core would also have made
the check possible, heavy to check before the separation and cheap after it. None needed a pure core
without a property. Five could not be caught by either.

| run | serious | prop, cheap | prop, heavy | both | neither |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| #202 | 34 | 16 | 5 | 10 | 3 |
| #216 | 17 | 9 | 3 | 5 | 0 |
| #252 | 14 | 1 | 4 | 9 | 0 |
| #268 | 19 | 11 | 6 | 0 | 2 |
| all | 84 | 37 | 18 | 24 | 5 |

Read the label for what it is. It says a check could have caught the finding, not that anyone would
have written it. Both readers know every defect, so hindsight is in the count, and a strict reading of
"an oracle that is not the code under test" could deflate it as easily. The count is an estimate of what a
property or a pure core could have done for these runs, and the proposed trials measure how far below it a
blind attempt lands.

**What kind of defect it was.** Grouping the findings by the shape of the missing check shows where the
pure core mattered and where it did not
[@trials/2026-10-04-review-findings-classified/results/kinds.md].

| kind of check | findings | prop, cheap | prop, heavy | both | neither |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A. A reader of text must obey a law (it splits, quotes, renders, parses or validates text) | 31 | 31 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| B. A reader must agree with a real tool, a format or git | 21 | 5 | 15 | 1 | 0 |
| C. A procedure over states and steps has a case missing (restore, attribution, process ids, exit status, reruns) | 12 | 0 | 2 | 10 | 0 |
| D. Two paths that must agree do not (dry run and real run, promote and check, range and files) | 7 | 1 | 1 | 5 | 0 |
| E. The environment or an effect leaks into a decision (ambient variables, a failed read read as a value, a forgotten log) | 8 | 0 | 0 | 8 | 0 |
| F. Runbook prose, or a decision inferred from free text: nothing to run | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 |

- **A and B, 52 findings: for most, structure was not the missing piece.** These sat in functions that already
  took text and returned values: a shell-command classifier, a scanner for suppression comments, renderers of the
  ship card, integrity checks on bundles. Five sat elsewhere: 202/bug-33, where the classifier probed the file
  system to decide whether a bare word was a path, and four in code that ran git, tar or the file system
  (252/bug-1 and bug-24, 216/bug-3 and sec-3), where the defect was in how the code ran them. A law over
  generated text, such as "the writes found in two commands joined by a newline are the union of the writes found
  in each" (#202, the first round), or "scanning the same text twice gives the same findings" (#216, a shared
  `/g/` regular expression that keeps state), would have found the first kind. The classifier (18 findings, in
  three families) and the scanner (16 findings, all in one library file) alone hold 34 of the 84. Both predict
  what another program will do from its text, which is the shape
  [#291, A ticket's acceptance criteria ask only for what a run can finish](https://github.com/brindlewick/postmaster/issues/291)
  names as one that cannot be finished. In #202 the rounds went on until a ruling removed the classifier and had
  the check observe what changed instead; rounds 8 and 9 then found three serious findings, about the card, the
  restore guard and ties between reviewers, none about what a command writes
  [@trials/2026-10-04-review-findings-classified/data/cards/202-checkpoint-review.md].
- **C, D and E, 27 findings: for 23, a pure core made the check possible.** These sat in procedures whose
  decisions were interleaved with reads of, or acts on, git, the file system, the environment, the process table
  or the log. In every one of the 23 a one-line law existed too: a restore changes only what the round
  changed (five findings in #202, in rounds 1, 1, 3, 7 and 9), a process group is signalled only when the launch
  record matches (#252), a git call's result does not depend on the ambient `GIT_*` variables (#202 round 2, #252
  round 3), an ambient `SCRUB_CHECK_DISABLE` must not reach the scan (#216, rounds 1 and 3), a read error is not
  an empty answer (#202, #252). The other four needed no separation: one is a pair of functions of text that must agree
  (268/bug-10), and three are properties that need real repositories (216/bug-7, 252/bug-14 and bug-15).
- **Four classes came back in later rounds or in other runs.** The ambient environment (4 findings in 3
  runs), restore (5 findings in rounds 1, 3, 7 and 9 of one run), the dry run against the real run (3 findings
  in 2 rounds, which the run's own escalation names as a design signal, since the dry run re-implements every
  real-run decision inline [@trials/2026-10-04-review-findings-classified/data/cards/252-ESCALATION.md]), and
  the identity of a suppression (#268, 4 findings in 3 rounds, which its escalation proposes to end with a
  conservative window, an approximation that errs toward asking
  [@trials/2026-10-04-review-findings-classified/data/cards/268-ESCALATION.md]).
- **F, 5 findings: nothing to run.** Three are runbook prose (a step omitted, a paragraph that misdescribes a
  state), one infers from the free text of a tool's output whether a call was refused (202/bug-1), and one is a
  tension in the classifier between failing closed and precision that no law states (202/bug-39).

**The tests that existed.** Every one of the four tools shipped example tests, and three of the four tickets
asked for them: #202's criterion 15 asks for "one test that must find it and one that must find nothing" for each
kind of thing the check looks for, #216's criterion 23 for tests that show each rule finding what it should and
passing what it should not, and #252's direction for tests with a positive and a negative control for each count.
The test files the four branches added hold 52 (#202), 52 (#216), 30 (#252) and 54 (#268) cases, and none runs a
generator over many cases in one test. A search for `Math.random`, `seeded`, `fast-check`, `forAll` and `fuzz`
finds only three `Math.random` calls in #202's tests, which make unique names; #252's tests build one random
1 KB file for a round trip and #216's build nested inputs at fixed depths
[@trials/2026-10-04-review-findings-classified/method.md]. The repository does have one seeded random
differential test, from
[#109, Rewrite the scripts in TypeScript, run by Bun](https://github.com/brindlewick/postmaster/issues/109):
"the decoder matches iconv -c on 300 seeded cases" in `scripts/log-action.test.ts`, about 50 lines with its
oracle, a small pseudo-random generator, a list of boundary bytes and a real tool as the oracle, and no library.
That is the pattern the A and B findings called for.

**One style finding sat on the root of a class.** In #216 round 1 the style lens reported, at the lowest
severity, "env reads + IO in core module against functional-core paradigm" at `scripts/scrub-core.ts:438`
[@trials/2026-10-04-review-findings-classified/data/finding-lines-216.jsonl]. That line reads
`SCRUB_CHECK_DISABLE` from the environment, and the finding does not name the variable. Two serious findings,
one in round 1 and one in round 3, are entries through which that variable reached the scans, which the run's
own card calls "the same DISABLE class in different entries, found one round apart", and the style finding
went to the ship card as a note
[@trials/2026-10-04-review-findings-classified/data/cards/216-checkpoint-review.md].

**How sure.** Firm: what the findings were, which code each sat in, and that two readers working apart agree on
whether a stated property could have caught a finding. Soft: the split between cheap and heavy (the readers
agreed on 8 of 15), the `clear` and `arguable` marks (14 of 26), and the by-construction field (16 of 26),
so the page gives the cheap and heavy counts as one reader's and rests nothing on the by-construction field. Of
the 84 findings the first reading marked 47 `clear` and 37 `arguable`. An independent fact-checker read eight
findings drawn at random and found six labels reasonable, one with an over-confident mark (202/bug-14) and one
whose cost label the code does not bear (216/sec-4, and its twin 216/bug-4, which has the same reason)
[@trials/2026-10-04-review-findings-classified/method.md]. Not measured: whether an author working from the
ticket and not from the review would have written the property and its generator. The data is four runs, two
of them in review when counted, and 34 of the 84 sit in two families.

## Trials postmaster could run

Five small trials, none run here. Each gives its cost in hours, what it would show and what would show it
failed. The costs are estimates, not measurements. The first measures what the count above cannot: how much of
it is hindsight.

**1. Properties written blind for a text classifier.** Take #202's shell-command classifier at its round-1
snapshot, before any review finding was fixed. A model that has not seen the findings gets the ticket and
the function signatures and writes at most ten laws with generators (separators and quoting leave the answer
unchanged, a substitution does not hide a write, an unresolved target is never read as clean), using the
seeded-generator pattern the repository already has or fast-check. They run against the snapshot. The control for the newline law is the fixed code with newline splitting
taken out again, which the law must fail (positive), and the code after the round-1 fix, which it must pass
(negative).
*Cost:* about 6 hours of the postmaster's time and a million tokens: two to write the laws, two for the
generators and a throwaway-directory oracle for the heavy ones, two to read the results against the
findings. *It would show* the share of the classifier family's round-1 findings (8 of the 18) that
blind-written laws find, which is the figure for how much of the cheap label is hindsight, on the five cheap
findings among them.
*It failed if* the laws find fewer than a third of those eight, if they fail on code the review later found
clean, or if the generators take more than a day.

**2. A small model of #202's restore.** Write about 100 lines in TLA+ or Alloy: refs that a round may move,
a synthesis worktree that may be attached, detached, a link or missing, files that may be dirty, and the
steps reset, update-ref, delete and save. State the law "a restore changes only what the round changed and
nothing outside the worktree", and check it exhaustively for three refs and two lanes, without reading the
five restore findings first.
*Cost:* 8 to 12 hours for a first model by someone new to the tool. Amazon's engineers report learning TLA+ in
two to three weeks, and the authors say the specifications added significant value in all ten systems
[@papers/aws-2014/passages.md]. *It would show* whether the model finds
the five restore findings of #202 (202/sec-1, sec-4, bug-22, bug-51, bug-57) in seconds, and how large a model
that took. *It failed if* it finds none, finds them only after the findings are written into it, or takes more than
two days.

**3. A proof spike with LemmaScript on one pure function, with a model writing the annotations.** Take the
10-line `ticketHasComment` of #252, the function that matched a longer comment by substring, which is a pure function
of two strings. First check whether it lies inside the subset LemmaScript verifies (strings, loops, comparisons; the
design note lists no regular expressions). The function calls `pyWords`, which splits on regular expressions built from
a Unicode class, so that check starts there. Then state the exact-match law as annotations, have a model write them and
the Dafny proof, run the tool's check, and have a person judge the specification the model wrote. Time each step.
*Cost:* 6 to 12 hours and one to two million tokens, most of it installing the toolchain, which needs Dafny, and
writing the specification; if the function falls outside the subset the trial ends in an hour with that result.
*It would show* whether a pure function of this project's own fits the verifiable subset, what one proof costs for
the simplest finding, whether the specification a model writes for itself would have rejected the substring version,
and how much of the generated Dafny a person must read to trust the translation, which the design note says is
checked by inspection. *It failed if* the function is outside the subset and a rewrite into it changes what it does,
if the work takes more than two days, if the specification the model wrote admits the buggy version, or if the proof
cannot be trusted without reading the generated Dafny line by line.

**4. A purity check in the gate.** Write a script, or switch on a rule, that flags `process.env`, `Date.now` and
imports of `node:fs`, `node:child_process` and `node:os` inside modules named `*-core.ts` or under `scripts/lib/`.
Biome's `noProcessEnv` and Oxlint's `node/no-process-env` each disallow `process.env` and are off by default
[@articles/biome-noprocessenv/passages.md] [@articles/oxlint-no-process-env/passages.md]. Oxlint runs in the gate, and
Biome runs there only as a formatter, so its rule would need `biome lint` or `biome check` added to `bun run check`.
Whether either can be scoped to one folder, or restricts imports and the clock, was not checked. Run the check on `main`
and at the review snapshots of the four runs; no module on `main` is named `*-core.ts` today, so on `main` it covers
`scripts/lib/`.
*Cost:* 2 to 3 hours. *It would show* whether it flags the environment reads in #216's `scrub-core.ts` (three at the round-1
snapshot, one of them the variable behind two of the eight E-kind findings), how many of the eight it
reaches, and how many places on `main` it flags that no one would call a defect. Several of the eight, such as a git
call that inherits `GIT_DIR`, sit at the edge, where a check on core modules does not look, and the trial counts them.
*It failed if* it flags none of the eight, or flags more than about twenty places on `main` that are not defects.

**5. Plan, then act, for the cleanup script's dry run.** At #252's round-1 snapshot, write a generator of
folder states (clean, dirty, locked, with a submodule, with an unbranched merge, with a preview running) and the
law "the dry run's plan equals what the real run does when nothing changes in between", and run it on a scratch
copy. Then move one decision, the refusal of a locked folder, into a `plan(state)` that both modes consume, and
run it again.
*Cost:* 8 to 10 hours. *It would show* whether generated states reach the three dry-run findings (252/bug-16,
bug-18, bug-23) before a reviewer does, and whether the shared plan makes the law hold by construction.
*It failed if* the generator cannot reach the locked or live-preview states without hand-built cases, or if the
law has to be told the findings to define its states.

What the trials would settle: the page stays **claimed** until runs made under a changed practice show fewer
serious findings per round than these four. The measure is close to the one
[when a review loop should stop](review-convergence.md) uses: serious findings reaching zero outside escalated
mechanisms within the cap, across at least three runs.

## Changes proposed to the design rules and the ticket template

Nothing here is made. Each follows from a finding above, and the first two wait for the trials named. The text
the proposals would change is that of `origin/main`: `AGENTS.md` and the ticket template read the same at `cd441e6` as at `b6283aa`.

**1. Give design rule 8 a narrow check.** Rule 8 reads "A computation takes its inputs as arguments and returns its
result. Reading files, the clock, the environment and processes happens at the edge of a script, not inside the
computation." Nothing enforces it, and that was chosen: decision D2 of
[#298](https://github.com/brindlewick/postmaster/issues/298), given by the user, says the rule is "a design rule in
the written rules, and no check enforces it", because no tool in the gate can decide whether a function is pure and a
lint rule "would flag good code and miss bad code". The check proposed here does not decide purity. It flags one narrow
thing, reads of the environment and the clock and imports of file, process and operating-system modules, inside
modules named `*-core.ts` or under `scripts/lib/`, and trial 4 counts the good code it would flag. It still asks the
user to reverse the "no check" half of D2. No module on `main` is named `*-core.ts` today, so as scoped it covers
`scripts/lib/`, whose helpers do I/O on purpose, and trial 4 counts what it flags there.
*Tied to:* the 8 findings of kind E, 4 of them the ambient environment in 3 runs, and to #216's round-1 style
finding that named the environment read in a core module at the lowest severity while two serious findings
traced to it.

**2. Add a design rule for tools that run dry or undo: plan, then act.** Proposed text: "A tool that can run dry
or undo builds its plan as data from the state it read. The dry run prints the plan and the real run carries it
out, so the two cannot disagree." *Tied to:* #252's three dry-run findings (252/bug-16, bug-18, bug-23), whose own
escalation names re-implementing every real-run decision inline as the design signal
[@trials/2026-10-04-review-findings-classified/data/cards/252-ESCALATION.md], and #202's five restore findings
(sec-1, sec-4, bug-22, bug-51, bug-57), where the restore decided between git calls. Trial 5 checks it on one
decision.

**3. In the template's Checks, give each reader a law.** The template asks for one check per criterion, and #202's
criterion 15 asked for one test that must find a thing and one that must find nothing. For a criterion about
something that reads text (it splits, scans, renders, parses or validates), propose that the check also name one
law over generated inputs and its oracle: a law (a round trip, the answer for joined parts is the union of the
answers for each, a check is never clean when it cannot tell), a reference the project already runs (the
compiler, the formatter, git), or the closed list of inputs the criterion covers. *Tied to:* kinds A and B, 52
of the 84 findings, which sat between the examples the tests held. The cost is about 50 lines for a seeded
generator, which the repository already has once, or a development dependency, which would change the list
that `AGENTS.md` gives as `typescript`, `@biomejs/biome` and `oxlint`. That choice is the user's.

**4. In the template's Checks, give an undo or a cleanup its state table.** For a criterion that restores,
undoes or removes, propose that the checks list the states it must handle and the expected result for each:
for a restore, a ref present, absent or moved, a worktree attached, detached, linked or missing, clean or
dirty. *Tied to:* kind C, 12 findings, among them #202's five restore findings across rounds 1, 3, 7 and 9
and #252's two missed kinds of unsaved state (a dirty submodule and an unbranched merge), each a case missing
from a list that no one had written.

**What does not follow.**

- **The four unfinishable shapes in the template already cover the largest families.** The classifier of #202
  and the scanner of #268 hold 34 of the 84 findings, and both forecast what another program will do from its
  text, which [#291](https://github.com/brindlewick/postmaster/issues/291) names. The records bear that rule out and call for no change to it.
- **A proof tool is not proposed yet.** After the cheap checks, 47 findings remain: 18 that need git or a real tool, 24
  that need a pure core as well, and the 5 of kind F, which have nothing to run. Nothing read shows a proof would help
  with any of them. The one current TypeScript tool found, LemmaScript, is a tech preview whose
  evidence is its own case studies [@articles/lemmascript-2026/passages.md]; the cost figures for proofs elsewhere are of
  another order; and in Cedar, the report found that counts both, differential and property-based testing found more
  bugs than the proofs did [@papers/cedar-2024/passages.md]. Trial 3 prices LemmaScript on the simplest finding, and an
  independent evaluation of it, or a measured result with models on TypeScript, would change this.
- **Effect and fp-ts are not proposed.** They shape code and prove nothing about its logic
  [@articles/effect-ts/passages.md] [@articles/fpts/passages.md]. Each is a runtime dependency, against the rule that
  runtime imports are Bun's built-ins and Node's standard modules, and no study found measures what adopting either
  costs a small tool. A function that returns a union of a value and an error gives the same shape with no
  dependency, and trial 5 uses that shape for the plan.

## What was not read

A search that finds nothing is not proof that nothing exists. What follows could not be read, or was read only in
part, and nothing is inferred from its title or an abstract snippet.

**How the sources were read.** The page-to-text tool paraphrases a page with a small model and gives no text for
some PDFs. Where it saved a PDF, its pages were read as images, and a quote is marked `checked` in the capture only
where two separate reads gave the same words. A figure that exists only in a plot cannot be read this way, so none is
used. Every other number was read from a table or from the text beside it.

**Language models writing verified code and proofs.**

- The VeriBench paper (listings and a PDF only); the workshop listings of two papers whose arXiv versions were read.
- Search hits not opened: a paper on the costs of proof synthesis for Rust systems (arXiv 2602.04910); a podcast with
  the Lean author; job postings and news about Google DeepMind's "Verified Code Generation"; three blog posts. A
  published anecdote of a specification with a transposed field that survived 49,280 discharged proof obligations could
  not be traced to a primary source and is not used.
- The benchmark repositories' data files and the vericoding results file (55,397 experiments).
- Baldur, miniCodeProps, SAFE, Anthropic's account of formalising Fermat's Last Theorem and Mistral's Lean model
  were cut to one-line pointers in the notes to stay within the cap.
- Not found: any measured result by Google DeepMind or the Lean FRO on a model writing verified code; any
  independent replication of the headline results of vericoding, Verina or VerifyThisBench under their own
  protocols (only CLEVER was re-run by a second team); the human time to review model-written specifications; any
  target in TypeScript or JavaScript (one search).

**Specifications, properties and tests written by models.**

- Bodies of FormalBench, PROBE and the loop-invariant paper of Pei and others (abstract pages only); Verina, CLEVER
  and VerifyThisBench were read from their abstracts for this group.
- Seen only in search results: Quokka, LiveFMBench, ClassInvGen, VeriStruct, REQ2LTL, VLTL-Bench, NeuroNL2LTL, a
  paper on repairing Alloy models with models, AugmenTest, SpecEval and Lemur. A VerifyThisBench "coherence 43%"
  figure appeared in one search summary and not on the abstract page, and is not used.
- Not found: a measured study of a model writing fast-check or any TypeScript property test; a controlled study
  comparing human-written properties with human-written examples; a study repeating nl2spec's or Clover's tests with
  newer models; a measurement of how often properties derived from requirements by Kiro are wrong.

**Proof assistants, verified languages and the cost of proofs.**

- Founding papers of Dafny, Agda, Liquid Haskell and Isabelle/HOL, the full POPL 2016 F* paper and the OOPSLA 2023
  Verus paper: not opened, for lack of budget, not because they were blocked.
- The original HACL* paper (blocked), so its cost figures are a survey's; the CACM version of Amazon's paper (blocked;
  the 2014 report was read); the 36-page Woodcock survey of 62 projects (only its four-page summary was read);
  Staples and others on proof productivity; the primary Tokeneer later-defect paper (second-hand only); the
  CPP 2016 paper on the Raft proof in Verdi (no effort figure for it); the Springer version of the Coq user survey;
  Amazon's SampCert and s2n papers.
- Not found: a user study of Lean, F*, Dafny or Verus; a controlled comparison of proving against testing on the same
  ordinary code; a cost figure for proofs on a small non-research program; independent measurement of effort for the
  2025 to 2026 industrial Lean and Verus projects; maintenance cost over time.

**Lightweight checking, model checking and TypeScript tooling.**

- The helper that read this group stopped before it could write its own list of what it left unread, and some of its
  early entries were drafted before it could see the pages they cite. Its notes say an entry is verified only if its url
  line says it was checked against the page images, and each capture in this group says whether its entry is. The two
  AUTOSAR papers were read in part and not verified, and are left out of the map.
- Not read: the original authors' rebuttal of the reproduction of the study of languages and defects; the rest of Hughes's
  1989 paper after its first three pages; the appendix of per-project data in the study of contracts; the Hypothesis
  journal paper (its page returned only a title).
- Model checking: the TLA+ manual, the primary Alloy papers and the Quint documentation were not read. Only the
  repositories' descriptions and the MongoDB abstract were, so the group rests on those and on Amazon's account.
- Tools that verify TypeScript: the case-study repositories of LemmaScript and the README of lemmafit were not read, the
  paper behind Refined TypeScript was read from its abstract only, and JaVerT and Gillian-JS, tools for verifying
  JavaScript, were seen in search results only.
- Not checked: whether Oxlint or Biome can restrict imports or the clock for one folder, whether fast-check or StrykerJS
  runs under `bun test` and Bun, and whether postmaster's own scripts lie inside the subset LemmaScript verifies. Not
  found: any measurement of what adopting Effect or fp-ts costs a small tool.

**Postmaster's own record.** Runs #252 and #268 were still in review: their round-4 findings, logged after the count,
are in the trial's data and are not among the 84. The first reading's labels rest on the descriptions on the runs'
review cards, the structure of the modules and the code at the round's snapshot; the trial does not record for which
findings the code was opened. A second reader read 26 of the 84, and an independent fact-checker re-read eight.

**How the page itself was checked.** Two independent readers checked the built page before it was published, one the
literature and one the record and the count. They compared it with the captures and, for about 140 of the literature's
figures and quotes, with the sources themselves, and compared the record's counts with the run branches and the trial's
data. What they found wrong, overstated, unsupported or missing a limit was corrected. Figures that only a reading
helper's notes support and the independent readers did not reach include PropertyGPT's precision and its per-project
recall range, the per-model numbers of Verus-SpecGym, and the rows for SysMoBench, Hong's Alloy study and Danso's
temporal-logic study; each capture says which of its quotes were read twice.

## Every serious finding, and what would have caught it

The 84 serious findings of the four runs, in the order of [the table of findings](../../raw/trials/2026-10-04-review-findings-classified/data/findings.tsv),
each with the first reader's label. `prop, cheap` and `prop, heavy` are a property that runs in process or
needs git, a shell or a real tool; `both` is a property and a pure core; `neither` is nothing to run. A
finding is `arguable` where a reasonable reader could have answered the other way. The keys are the ids the
runs' own review cards use.

| finding | round | what it was | label | what would have caught it, or why nothing |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #202 bug-1 | 1 | refusal attribution hides a successful write beside a denial | neither (arguable) | Whether a call was refused is read from the call's free-text output as a whole; the only oracle is what changed on disk, which the run later observed instead. |
| #202 bug-2 | 1 | a write after a newline reads as a read | prop, cheap | The writes found in two commands joined by a newline are the union of the writes found in each. |
| #202 sec-1 | 1 | restore resets unmoved branches and wipes uncommitted work | both | Restoring a round changes only the refs and files the round changed. Extract: planRestore(snapshot refs, current refs, worktree state) returning the actions to take. |
| #202 bug-3 | 1 | bare cd and cd under an environment variable ignored | prop, cheap | cd D then c reports what c reports with relative paths taken from D; when D cannot be resolved, later relative paths are reported as unresolved, never as inside. |
| #202 bug-4 | 1 | the git block misses escapes (branch and tag names, dropped operands, redirects off git) | prop, heavy (arguable) | For each git subcommand in the closed list, the reported writes equal the refs and files that changed when it ran in a temporary repository. |
| #202 bug-5 | 1 | the shell-group rewrite flips inside reads to notes | prop, cheap (arguable) | A path inside the lane's own folder is reported as expected, however the command is grouped (braces, subshell). |
| #202 bug-6 | 1 | reads outside the home directory and the project not exempt, and tool-checkout and brief reads unreachable | prop, cheap | A read of any path in the ticket's normal-read categories (outside HOME and the repository, the tool checkout, the brief) is not reported. |
| #202 bug-11 | 1 | hostile filenames break the card block | prop, cheap | For any path string the rendered card block keeps its own structure and parses back to the same findings. |
| #202 sec-2 | 1 | git configuration values never skipped | prop, heavy (arguable) | git -c key=value and git config operands are never counted as paths written. |
| #202 sec-3 | 1 | refs named by git reads counted as writes | prop, cheap | A read-only git subcommand never reports a write, whatever refs it names. |
| #202 sec-4 | 1 | reset climbs when the synthesis metadata is missing | both (arguable) | A restore from a snapshot that lacks its metadata changes nothing. Extract: planRestore returns a refusal when the snapshot is incomplete. |
| #202 style-1 | 1 | quoted shell text misread as a redirect (a gating defect reported under the style lens) | prop, cheap | Quoting text never changes the reported writes: for any text t, echo 't' reports no write. |
| #202 bug-14 | 2 | git subprocesses honor inherited directory overrides | both | A git call's result does not depend on the ambient GIT_* variables. Extract: gitEnv(base environment) returning the environment git runs with. |
| #202 bug-15 | 2 | substitutions inside double quotes skipped | prop, cheap | Wrapping a command in a double-quoted substitution does not change its reported writes. |
| #202 bug-16 | 2 | a rider claims file changes its move did not produce | both (arguable) | A change is attributed to a lane only if its record names the path or the ref (#202's D2), and a file rides a move only if the move changed it. Extract: attribute(changes, lane records, moved files). |
| #202 bug-17 | 2 | the card reason is not escaped | prop, cheap | For any reason string the rendered card block keeps its own structure. |
| #202 bug-21 | 3 | descriptor-duplication redirects invent a path write | prop, cheap | Appending 2>&1 to a command does not change its reported writes. |
| #202 bug-22 | 3 | restore faults instead of reattaching a detached synthesis worktree | both | For every state of the synthesis worktree (attached, detached) a restore returns to the snapshot. Extract: planRestore over a worktree state value. |
| #202 bug-23 | 3 | an unreadable task transcript still counts as checked | both | An unreadable record is never reported as checked (#202's D13). Extract: laneStatus(read result), where the result can be an error. |
| #202 bug-26 | 4 | a write redirect onto a substitution target reads as a read | prop, cheap (arguable) | A write whose target cannot be resolved is reported as an unresolved write, never as a read. |
| #202 bug-27 | 4 | a write or delete under a glob or an unset variable reads clean | prop, cheap (arguable) | A write or delete under a glob or an unset variable is never reported clean. |
| #202 bug-30 | 5 | file tools drop a path holding a variable or a glob | prop, cheap (arguable) | A file tool's path holding a variable or a glob is reported as unresolved, never dropped. |
| #202 bug-33 | 5 | a bare write operand is dropped | both | An operand a command writes is reported whatever its spelling. Extract: classify(command, role table) deciding paths by operand role, not by probing the filesystem. |
| #202 bug-35 | 5 | the card prints a not-checked reason as the lane wrote it | prop, cheap | For any not-checked reason the card prints it in a form that cannot break the block. |
| #202 bug-36 | 5 | the round reach step restores after a faulted check | neither (arguable) | A step order in runbook prose (restore after a faulted check); a model of a design that has the rule does not flag prose that forgot it. |
| #202 bug-39 | 6 | ordinary commands with patterns read not checked | neither (arguable) | A tension between failing closed and precision, settled by each tool's argument roles; no law states it, and the ticket's notes did not. |
| #202 bug-46 | 7 | a substitution split hides writes | prop, cheap | A substitution inside a write command does not hide the outer write. |
| #202 bug-47 | 7 | cp roles confused under substitution | prop, heavy (arguable) | For cp, the destination is reported as written whatever substitutions the operands hold. |
| #202 bug-49 | 7 | the sed long in-place form missed | prop, heavy (arguable) | Every spelling of sed's in-place option is reported as a write. |
| #202 bug-50 | 7 | a repository path with a space faults every check | prop, heavy | A check's result does not depend on where the repository is (spaces, quotes, non-ASCII in the path). |
| #202 bug-51 | 7 | restore faults on a deleted run branch | both | A restore returns to the snapshot whether or not a run branch still exists. Extract: planRestore over a ref map in which refs can be absent. |
| #202 bug-53 | 8 | the card prints unresolved non-absolute paths verbatim (found under the security lens, below that lane's own reporting threshold, verified by the coachman) | prop, cheap | No path outside the project appears on the card (#202's D18). |
| #202 bug-57 | 9 | the synthesis guard passes a symlinked worktree and restore then resets the main checkout | both (arguable) | A restore changes nothing outside the synthesis worktree it was given, whatever that path is (directory, symlink, file, missing). Extract: guard(stat of the path, repository root). |
| #202 bug-58 | 9 | only the first tied reviewer is voided | both | When several lanes' records explain one change, every one of them is named. Extract: attribute(changes, lane records) returning all owners. |
| #216 bug-1 | 1 | PATTERN_CODE skips whole line, const-EMAIL-plus-address passes gate | prop, cheap | A private value placed anywhere in a line is flagged, whatever else the line holds. |
| #216 bug-2 | 1 | card scan inherits SCRUB_CHECK_DISABLE via run env merge; same hole in scrub-rewrite.ts parseFindings | both | The scan's result does not depend on the ambient SCRUB_CHECK_DISABLE. Extract: scan(text, explicit config) with the environment read only at the edge. |
| #216 bug-3 | 1 | symlinked dest ancestor escapes repo on mkdir+rename | prop, cheap | A promote writes nothing outside the repository, whatever symlinks the destination path holds. |
| #216 bug-4 | 1 | --check passes edited bundle body on matching header hash | prop, cheap | Any single-byte change to a bundle fails --check. |
| #216 bug-5 | 1 | privateDataBlock freezes heldout scores + D1/D8/D9/D19 into every future card, check requires verbatim match | prop, cheap (arguable) | The block depends only on the run's own inputs: two runs with different inputs give blocks that differ exactly there. |
| #216 bug-7 | 2 | range scan misses UTF-16 content that --files finds | prop, heavy | Scanning a commit range and scanning the same content as files give the same findings, for any text encoding. |
| #216 bug-9 | 3 | block generator dies over 50 census suspects, accepted 236-line census unrepresentable, card step blocked | prop, cheap | For any number of suspects the block renders and parses back. |
| #216 bug-10 | 3 | ambient DISABLE turns promote scrub into straight copy; same hole in tree-check entry, gate chain, runbook scan commands | both | The result does not depend on the ambient DISABLE variable, in promote, tree-check and the gate chain. Extract: one config value built at the edge and passed down. |
| #216 bug-11 | 3 | hasReasoning depth-64 fail-open, 66-deep encrypted_content passes tree gate | prop, cheap | A record nested to any depth is judged, and a depth limit fails closed. |
| #216 bug-12 | 3 | marker strip eats closing JSON syntax, malformed record promoted exit 0 | prop, cheap | Stripping markers from a valid record yields a valid record or a refusal. |
| #216 bug-14 | 4 | MAIL.test on /g/ regex without reset, successive bare key fields miss key intermittently | prop, cheap | Scanning the same text twice gives the same findings. |
| #216 bug-15 | 4 | placeholder keeps encrypted_content field, tree-check flags presence, success promotion fails gate | both (arguable) | Everything promote writes passes tree-check. Extract: scrubRecord(record) and treeCheckRecord(record) as functions of one record. |
| #216 bug-16 | 4 | reasoning findings never call logFinding in tree-check or promote, TELL and card blind to the class | both (arguable) | A failing check logs at least one finding. Extract: check(tree) returning findings, with logging done once at the edge. |
| #216 bug-17 | 4 | pr-description/card scans log draft rows, TELL fires, block dies without resolution, landing stuck | both (arguable) | A draft scan leaves the detections log unchanged. Extract: scanDraft(text) returning findings and logging nothing. |
| #216 sec-2 | 4 | raw path in manual-reword refusal prints finding value, violates rule 10 and C10 | prop, heavy | No message the tool prints contains a value the scanner would flag: scan the tool's own output. |
| #216 sec-3 | 4 | show %B appends newline, every recreated commit gets a new id, pushed untouched commits rewritten, C18 broken | prop, heavy | Recreating a commit whose message needs no change gives the same commit id. |
| #216 sec-4 | 4 | header line 2 and unanchored pattern outside body digest, injected code passes --check and runs | prop, cheap | Any single-byte change to a bundle fails --check, including the header lines. |
| #252 bug-1 | 1 | tar and git byte outputs decoded as UTF-8 corrupt saves of non-UTF8 files, then the folder is removed | prop, heavy | Saving then restoring any file's bytes returns the same bytes. |
| #252 bug-2 | 1 | a reused pid with an overwritten registry record passes the start check, signalling another launch's group | both | A process group is signalled only when the launch record names this run's folder and the recorded start time matches. Extract: decideStop(record, process table, run folder, boot id). |
| #252 bug-3 | 1 | preview left with synthesis already gone still closes the run and exits 0 | both | The exit status is zero only when every step finished. Extract: exitFor(steps). |
| #252 bug-4 | 1 | .worktrees read errors treated as empty, silently omitting unscanned folders | both | A read error is not an empty answer. Extract: candidates(read result, ticket), where the read result can be an error. |
| #252 bug-5 | 1 | substring run-log check skips the closing line and faults a wordless rerun of a closed run | both (arguable) | A closing line counts as written only if an entry equals it, and running the command twice gives what running it once does. |
| #252 bug-14 | 2 | dirty submodule contents invisible to the save and deleted with the worktree | prop, heavy (arguable) | After saving and removing a folder, every path that differed from what git holds is in the save. |
| #252 bug-15 | 2 | format-patch omits unbranched merges, losing their resolutions on removal | prop, heavy (arguable) | After saving and removing a folder, every commit and resolution that was only in the folder is in the save. |
| #252 bug-16 | 2 | dry run promises removal of a locked worktree the real run must leave | both | The dry run's plan equals what the real run does when nothing changes in between. Extract: plan(state) consumed by both the dry run and the real run. |
| #252 bug-17 | 2 | reconcile substring matches a longer comment and skips the post | prop, cheap | A comment counts as present only when an entry equals it, never when a longer entry contains it. |
| #252 bug-18 | 2 | dry run exits 3 on a live preview the real run stops and closes | both | The dry run exits as the real run would when nothing changes. Extract: plan(state) consumed by both. |
| #252 bug-22 | 3 | inherited GIT_DIR/GIT_WORK_TREE override git -C, scanning the wrong checkout before removal | both | A git call's result does not depend on the ambient GIT_* variables. Extract: gitEnv(base environment). |
| #252 bug-23 | 3 | dry run promises a pin release that a lock refuses in the real run | both | The dry run promises a pin release only if the real run will make it. Extract: plan(state) consumed by both. |
| #252 bug-24 | 3 | core.quotePath quoted paths fail hash-object, silently missing flags | prop, heavy | The paths parsed from git's output equal the names on disk, for any file name. |
| #252 bug-25 | 3 | plane.sh takes no repo arg, so every Plane run stops at ticket-state | both (arguable) | Every adapter call the tool builds is accepted by that adapter, for each tracker kind. Extract: adapterCall(kind, repo, ticket) returning the argument list. |
| #268 bug-1 | 1 | biome-ignore covers the next node but the identity hashes one line | prop, heavy (arguable) | When any line a directive really covers is edited, the approval identity changes. |
| #268 bug-2 | 1 | block closes pop whole stack but Oxlint matches by rule set and ignores bare enable | prop, heavy (arguable) | The lines the scanner says a directive covers include every line the real linter suppresses. |
| #268 bug-5 | 1 | switch-off ask never writes .waiting-on-user | neither | Anchor: a step the runbook prose left out; nothing to run, and a model cannot flag prose that forgot a step. |
| #268 bug-6 | 1 | exit-2 paragraph misdescribes held and its remedy cannot clear it | neither | Anchor: runbook prose that misdescribed a state and a remedy. |
| #268 bug-7 | 2 | triple-slash TS suppressions honored but not parsed | prop, cheap (arguable) | Every suppression form the TypeScript compiler honours is found by the scanner. |
| #268 security-4 | 2 | TS block directives read first line but tsc reads last | prop, cheap (arguable) | The lines the scanner says a TS block directive covers include every line tsc suppresses. |
| #268 security-5 | 2 | TS next-line identity misses tsc blank and comment skipping | prop, cheap (arguable) | The scanner's next-line identity changes whenever the line tsc suppresses is edited. |
| #268 bug-8 | 2 | linter block rules read first line only but Oxlint reads across lines | prop, heavy (arguable) | Block rules cover every line the real Oxlint suppresses. |
| #268 security-6 | 2 | Biome block directives read first line only but Biome reads any line | prop, heavy (arguable) | Block directives cover every line the real Biome suppresses. |
| #268 bug-9 | 2 | JSX-text double-slash swallows a trailing directive | prop, cheap (arguable) | A directive at the end of a line is found whatever the line's earlier text holds (strings, regexes, JSX text). |
| #268 security-7 | 2 | apostrophe in JSX text opens a fake string hiding directives | prop, cheap (arguable) | The same law as bug-9, with JSX text holding an apostrophe. |
| #268 security-8 | 2 | slash after a condition paren divide-read hides regex directives | prop, cheap (arguable) | The same law as bug-9, with a slash after a closing parenthesis (division against regex). |
| #268 security-9 | 2 | slash after plus-plus regex-read hides trailing directives | prop, cheap (arguable) | The same law as bug-9, with a slash after ++. |
| #268 security-10 | 2 | strings and regexes end at U+2028 which ES2019 allows inside | prop, cheap (arguable) | The same law as bug-9, with U+2028 inside strings and regexes. |
| #268 bug-10 | 2 | covered lines split Python-wide while the scanner counts tsc-narrow | prop, cheap | The function that splits covered lines and the scanner's own line counting agree on any text. |
| #268 bug-12 | 3 | unclosed quote in JSX text swallows a trailing directive the tool honors | prop, cheap (arguable) | The same law as bug-9, with an unclosed quote in JSX text. |
| #268 bug-13 | 3 | Biome identity stops before an implicit continuation | prop, heavy (arguable) | The Biome identity changes whenever any line Biome's node covers is edited, including an operator continuation. |
| #268 security-12 | 3 | block-comment next-line identity hashes a comment line not the covered code | prop, heavy (arguable) | A next-line identity hashes the code the directive covers, not a comment line before it. |
| #268 bug-14 | 3 | switch-off record accepted with no user words | prop, cheap | A switch-off record without the user's words is refused. |
