# Oracle for #85: blind acceptance tests at the ticket's own interface.
#
# Written by the leg-1 coachman before reading any lane's diff, committed as the
# first commit on the ticket branch. It checks properties the ticket names, never
# one phrasing of them: no self-test pipes output into grep -q under pipefail;
# the old pipe form races SIGPIPE on this machine while the herestring form does
# not; and the host.sh and review-round.sh self-tests pass repeated runs while
# four other self-tests run alongside.
#
#   oracle-85.sh [static|race|load]   run from the repo root; exit 0 when the
#                                    worktree meets the ticket, 1 otherwise,
#                                    one line per probe. No argument runs all.
#                                    ORACLE_LOAD_N sets the load rounds (5).
#
# AC1 (causes in the PR text), AC3 (timing controls keep their teeth) and AC4
# (waits end on events) have no generic probe; they are verified by reading plus
# targeted execution at synthesis, and recorded on the checkpoint card.
