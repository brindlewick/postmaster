# Oracle for #266: blind acceptance tests at the ticket's own interface.
#
# Written from the ticket's checks C1-C9 before any lane's diff, committed on
# the ticket branch, and run against each lane's work at harvest by cherry-picking
# this commit onto a scratch of the lane. Every test uses only what the ticket
# names - the gate's check line, refusal shapes, file names and command output -
# never a script name, flag or file the lanes chose. The runbook check is found
# by reading package.json's check line and running each scripts/run step in it
# except wiki-lint, so the oracle works whether the lane extended skill-refs or
# wrote a new script. Nothing is planted in the worktree: every planting goes to
# a scratch copy, as the ticket requires.
#
# Three checks have no oracle coverage here. C5's full gate is the harvest's own
# `verify run` on each lane; the oracle only runs the check steps on the
# unmodified tree. C6's replacement scripts take names and flags the lanes
# choose, so they are covered by the lanes' beside-the-script tests and by
# reading at harvest. C9's fixture run is the coachman's, on the synthesis.
